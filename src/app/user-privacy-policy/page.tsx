          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>BJ Dhanvi Software Solutions Private Limited with brand name Fit-C (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, how we use and share it, and your rights regarding that data. We comply with applicable Indian laws, including the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, and relevant guidelines of app distribution platforms (Apple App Store and Google Play Store). We follow industry best practices to safeguard your information and we do not sell your personal data or use it for third-party advertising without your consent. By using Fit-C&apos;s services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of our platform.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the data necessary to provide and improve our services. This includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Personal Identity and Contact Information:</strong>
        <p>Name, email address, phone number, postal address, login credentials, and profile details provided when you create an account.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Fitness &amp; Health Information:</strong>
        <p>Data you provide about your fitness goals, nutrition and lifestyle (e.g. diet preferences, meal logs), workout history, physical attributes (such as height, weight, body measurements), and any health conditions or injuries you choose to disclose. This also includes biometric data and wellness metrics (e.g. BMI, body fat percentage, heart rate, step count) collected via our app or through integrated fitness wearables.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Workout and Activity Data:</strong>
        <p>Records of your workout sessions, exercise plans, class bookings, attendance, and progress logs. For example, we may record the number of sessions attended, types of exercises completed, and performance metrics (like calories burned or workout duration). If you use features like “live energy” video tracking during workouts, we may process camera outputs to track activity levels.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Device and Usage Information:</strong>
        <p>Technical data automatically collected when you use our website or apps, such as IP address, device identifiers, operating system, browser type, app version, and usage logs (pages or screens visited, features used, timestamps). We also use cookies or similar technologies to remember your preferences and analyze usage patterns, in compliance with applicable cookie laws. This usage data is typically aggregated and not used to personally identify you where possible.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Location Data:</strong>
        <p>With your permission, we may collect approximate location information (e.g. through your mobile device&apos;s GPS or network) to show nearby fitness centres or relevant local content. You can disable location access at any time in your device settings.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Payment and Transaction Data:</strong>
        <p>If you make purchases or subscribe to services through Fit-C, we collect data necessary to process payments – such as billing name, transaction amount, and payment method details. We do not store full credit/debit card numbers or UPI IDs on our servers; payments are handled through secure, PCI-compliant payment gateways.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Third-Party Integrations Data:</strong>
        <p>If you choose to integrate third-party services (for example, syncing a wearable device or linking your Apple Health or Google Fit account), we will receive certain information from those services (such as your step count, heart rate, or other fitness metrics). Note: Any data from Apple HealthKit or Google Fit or any similar apps that you share with Fit-C is handled in accordance with their respective guidelines – we only use it to provide health and fitness features to you, and not for advertising or onward sharing. For example, if you connect Apple Health, we comply with Apple&apos;s HealthKit developer guidelines on data use, and if you connect Google Fit, we abide by the Google Fit Terms of Service.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>User-Generated Content:</strong>
        <p>Information you post or upload on our platform, such as profile photos, workout images, comments on community forums, challenge participation, or feedback. This may include images (like progress photos or check-in snapshots taken via the app) and social interactions (likes, comments, etc.).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Sensitive Personal Data:</strong> Some of the information we collect (e.g. health, biometric, or medical information) may be considered sensitive under applicable law. By providing such data, you consent to our processing of it for the purposes described in this policy. We will treat sensitive data with strict confidentiality and additional security measures.</p>

    <p>You can choose not to provide certain information. However, not providing necessary data may limit your ability to register or use some features of Fit-C. Where possible, we anonymize or de-identify personal data (especially health data) when using it for analytics or improving services, and we commit not to re-identify anonymized data.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Fit-C uses your personal data to operate, provide, and enhance our services in a lawful manner. Key uses include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Providing and Personalizing Services:</strong>
        <p>We use your information to create and manage your account, and to deliver the features you signed up for. For example, personal and health data are used to generate AI-driven workout or diet recommendations tailored to you, to track your progress, and to enable trainers to customize your fitness plans. We may also use data to optimize the user experience (such as remembering your preferences or suggesting relevant classes based on your history).</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Facilitating Bookings and Memberships:</strong>
        <p>Your data is used to schedule gym or class bookings, manage your gym memberships, process payments for sessions or subscriptions, and send you booking confirmations or reminders.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Communication:</strong>
        <p>We use contact information to send you service-related communications – e.g. workout reminders, trainer messages, account alerts, or support responses. With your consent, we may also send promotional messages about new features, offers, or fitness content that might interest you. You can opt-out of marketing emails or texts at any time. (Note: even if you opt out of marketing, we may still send essential transactional communications like payment receipts or security alerts.)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Health and Fitness Insights:</strong>
        <p>The platform may analyze your fitness and biometric data to provide insights and recommendations. For instance, if the AI retention engine detects you haven’t logged a workout for 3 days, it might trigger a motivational message or suggest an appropriate program. All such processing is to help you reach your wellness goals in a supportive manner.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Improving and Innovating:</strong>
        <p>We continually improve Fit-C. We use aggregated, de-identified usage data to understand how users interact with our app (e.g. which features are most popular) and to diagnose technical issues. This helps us enhance features, develop new offerings, and improve performance. We may also use feedback you provide (such as survey responses or support tickets) to improve our services.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Safety and Security:</strong>
        <p>Information is used to maintain the security of our platform and users. This includes authenticating user identity, detecting and preventing fraud or unauthorized access, and enforcing our Terms &amp; Conditions. For example, we may use device and log data to monitor for suspicious login attempts.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Legal Compliance:</strong>
        <p>Where required, we will use or disclose information to comply with legal obligations under Indian law or respond to valid legal process (e.g. court orders or government requests). We may also use data to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Other Purposes with Notice:</strong>
        <p>If we intend to use your personal information for any purpose not covered above, we will provide specific notice at the time of collection or obtain your consent as required by law. We will only process personal data for purposes that are compatible with those disclosed to you, or as otherwise permitted by law.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We rely on the following legal bases for processing your data: your consent (for example, for processing health data or sending marketing communications), contractual necessity (to provide the services you requested), and legitimate interests (to improve our product, secure our platform, etc.), balanced with your rights and expectations. Where consent is required, you have the right to withdraw it at any time.</p>

    <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>Fit-C respects the confidentiality of your data. We do not share or disclose personal information to third parties except in the following circumstances:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>With Fitness Centres and Trainers:</strong>
        <p>If you are using Fit-C as a member of a partner gym/fitness centre or working with a trainer through our platform, relevant information will be shared with them. For example, when you book a session at a centre, that centre and the trainer get your booking details and profile info needed to serve you (such as your name, membership status, and any pertinent health notes you’ve shared). Trainers can view their clients’ workout logs and progress metrics to tailor training plans. This sharing is inherent to the service – it enables centres and trainers to provide you with guidance and track your performance. These partners are bound by confidentiality obligations and are only allowed to use the information for serving you via Fit-C.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Service Providers:</strong>
        <p>We employ trusted third-party companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf – such as payment processing, cloud hosting, data analytics, email/SMS delivery, or customer support tools. They may have access to personal data only as needed to perform their tasks for us, and are contractually obligated to protect it and use it solely for our specified purposes. For example, our payment gateway will receive your payment details to process transactions, or an email service may handle sending workout reminder emails to you.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
        <p>If Fit-C (or substantially all of its assets) is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred to the successor or partner entity as part of that transaction. If such a change happens, we will ensure the new entity continues to honor your privacy rights as per this policy and applicable law.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Legal and Safety Disclosures:</strong>
        <p>We may disclose personal information when required by law or in good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation or government request; (b) protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Fit-C, our users, or the public; (c) investigate and address violations of our Terms &amp; Conditions or other agreements; or (d) detect and prevent fraud or security issues. For instance, if law enforcement provides a lawful subpoena regarding a user, we may be compelled to provide the requested data.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>With Consent:</strong>
        <p>We will share your personal data with third parties outside the above scenarios only if you have given consent. For example, if you opt-in to integrate a third-party nutrition app or insurer with Fit-C, we will share data with that specific third party as authorized by you. You can revoke such consent at any time.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>De-identified Insights:</strong>
        <p>We may share aggregated, anonymized statistics that cannot identify you personally – for example, fitness trend reports or usage patterns – with business partners, researchers, or in marketing materials. (For clarity, these do not include any personally identifiable information about you.)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Fit-C does not sell your personal information to any third-party advertisers. We also do not share health-related data from Apple HealthKit or similar sources with third parties for marketing or data mining purposes, in line with those platforms’ rules.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take the security of your data seriously. Fit-C implements a combination of administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. These measures include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Encryption:</strong>
        <p>We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to secure data transmitted between your device and our servers. Sensitive data (like passwords and health metrics) are stored in encrypted form in our databases. For example, passwords are hashed and not stored in plain text. Payment transactions are processed over secure encrypted channels and handled by PCI-compliant providers.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Access Controls:</strong>
        <p>Internally, personal data is accessible only to those employees, contractors, and service providers who need it to perform their work. They are subject to strict confidentiality obligations. We enforce least-privilege access and regularly review permissions.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Security Testing and Monitoring:</strong>
        <p>Our systems are routinely tested for vulnerabilities. We employ firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-malware tools to monitor and protect our network. Suspicious activities or login attempts may trigger account safeguards (such as multi-factor authentication or user alerts).</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Data Minimization:</strong>
        <p>We only keep personal data for as long as necessary (see Data Retention below). We avoid collecting or storing any data that we do not truly need for providing the service or meeting legal requirements. This principle of minimization reduces risk.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Training and Policies:</strong>
        <p>Our staff are trained on data protection best practices and we maintain internal policies to handle user data safely. We also have an appointed Grievance Officer/Data Protection Officer as required by Indian law to address security and privacy issues (contact details provided below in Section 9).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>While we strive to protect your information, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant absolute security of any information. However, we will promptly notify you and the appropriate authorities of any data breaches that compromise your personal data, as required by law.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. In general:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Profile and account information is kept until you delete your account or we no longer require the data to provide services.</p></li>
      <li><p>Fitness and activity data are retained to allow you and your trainers to track progress over time. If you remain a user, this data will be available in your account history unless you request deletion.</p></li>
      <li><p>Transaction records are retained for the duration needed for accounting, auditing, and compliance with financial laws (for example, we may keep invoice records for several years as mandated by tax regulations).</p></li>
      <li><p>If you delete your account or request erasure of certain data, we will securely remove or anonymize that data within a reasonable time frame, unless we are required to keep it for legitimate business or legal purposes. Even after deletion from active systems, residual copies might persist in backups for a brief period but will be purged according to our backup retention schedules.</p></li>
      <li><p>Any anonymized data (which is not identifiable to you) may be retained indefinitely for analytics.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>When determining retention periods, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes of processing, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>As a user of Fit-C, especially one located in India, you have certain rights regarding your personal data. We are committed to honoring your rights as a “Data Principal” under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act and other applicable laws, as well as general privacy principles:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Right to Access:</strong>
        <p>You can request details of the personal data we hold about you, and obtain a copy of such data in a portable format. Most of your basic profile and fitness information is available in your account dashboard, but you may contact us for a full data report.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Right to Correction:</strong>
        <p>If any of your information is inaccurate or outdated, you have the right to have it corrected or updated. You can edit much of your personal and health information directly via the app (profile settings). For any data not editable by you, you may request correction and we will update it as appropriate.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Right to Erasure:</strong>
        <p>You may request deletion of your personal data. For example, you can delete certain health logs or even delete your account entirely. We will comply, except where retention is required by law or legitimate interests (in which case we will inform you accordingly). Do note that deleting your account will remove your data from active use and you will lose access to any bookings or content tied to your account.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong>
        <p>Where we rely on your consent to process data (such as for marketing emails or processing of health data), you can withdraw that consent at any time. For instance, you can unsubscribe from marketing communications using the link in emails or via account settings. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Right to Grievance Redressal:</strong>
        <p>If you have any concerns or grievances regarding your personal data, you have the right to raise a complaint. We encourage you to contact us (see Section 9) so we can address the issue. Under Indian law, you may also escalate unresolved issues to the Data Protection Board of India or other appropriate authority once the law&apos;s provisions for enforcement are in effect.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong>
        <p>To the extent applicable, you may have the right to request that we transfer your data to you or to another service provider in a machine-readable format, when technically feasible.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Choices in Data Sharing:</strong>
        <p>You have control over what information you choose to add to your profile or share with trainers/centres. For instance, you can decide whether to connect third-party apps or which health metrics to track. You can also configure privacy settings on any community features (like whether your profile or achievements are visible to others in a leaderboard).</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Cookies &amp; Tracking Choices:</strong>
        <p>Most web browsers allow you to control cookies. You may set your browser to refuse cookies or delete them. However, note that some parts of our service (like login or preferences) might not function properly if cookies are disabled. We do not support Do Not Track (DNT) signals at this time due to lack of industry consensus, but we respect any clear opt-outs for targeted advertising if applicable.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>No Discrimination:</strong> Exercising these rights will not lead to any discrimination in the service you receive. We will not deny you services or provide a lesser experience because you have exercised your data protection rights.</p>

    <p>To exercise any of your rights, please contact us at the details provided in Section 9 (Grievance Officer). We will need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests (to protect your data from unauthorized access). We will respond to your requests within a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with applicable law (generally within 15 days for grievances in India, or as otherwise stipulated).</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
    <p>Our platform may contain links to third-party websites or allow you to access third-party services (such as wearable device platforms, social media, or payment gateways) through our interface. This Privacy Policy does not cover any third-party services that we do not control. If you click on a third-party link or integrate an external service, you will be subject to that third party&apos;s terms and privacy policy, and we are not responsible for their practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you interact with via Fit-C.</p>

    <p><strong>Notably:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If you make in-app purchases on Apple&apos;s App Store or Google Play Store, those transactions are governed by Apple&apos;s or Google&apos;s own terms and privacy policies. We receive only limited information necessary to record your subscription/purchase (such as confirmation of payment and product purchased). Your financial information in such cases is handled by Apple/Google, not by Fit-C.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Our platform may integrate with Apple HealthKit or Google Fit as described. Apple and Google do not receive or access your Fit-C data through these integrations unless you separately consent to share it via their platforms. We simply read/write certain data to your HealthKit/Google Fit based on your instructions, in compliance with their rules.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>If you use a single sign-on or social media login (if offered), we may receive basic profile info from those platforms as permitted by your settings with them. We will use it solely for authentication and linking your accounts.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We strive to partner with reputable third parties that align with our privacy standards. However, any data you provide directly to a third-party (for example, entering payment details on a payment gateway&apos;s form, or posting content on an external social page) is governed by that third party&apos;s privacy practices.</p>

    <h2>9. Grievance Officer &amp; Contact Information</h2>
    <p>Fit-C has appointed a Grievance Officer (Data Protection Officer) to address any questions or complaints you may have about your personal data or this Privacy Policy. If you have any grievances, requests, or require clarifications, please reach out to us:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Grievance/Data Protection Officer:</strong></p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Email:</strong> support@fitcapp.com</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Contact Address:</strong></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please provide a detailed description of your issue or request, along with any relevant account information. We will acknowledge and endeavor to resolve grievances within 15 (fifteen) days of receipt, or within the timeframe prescribed by law. For security or privacy-specific requests (like data access or erasure), we may require verification of identity.</p>

    <h2>10. Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Fit-C&apos;s services are not directed to children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from minors under 16 without parental consent. If you are under 16, you should use the app only with involvement of a parent or guardian. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 16 without proper consent, we will take steps to delete such information. Parents or guardians who believe their child has provided us personal data without consent can contact our Grievance Officer to request deletion.</p>

    <h2>11. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Currently, Fit-C primarily operates in India and stores user data on servers located in India. However, as a SaaS platform, we may use cloud infrastructure or service providers located in other countries. If your data is transferred outside of India (for example, to a cloud server or support team in another region), we will ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to protect your information. We will only transfer data to jurisdictions that are recognized as having robust data protection laws or where we can ensure protection through contractual measures (such as standard data protection clauses). Your continued use of our services signifies your consent to such cross-border data transfers, if and when they occur. We remain committed to protecting your rights regardless of where your data is processed.</p>

    <h2>12. Updates to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or new features. When we make material changes, we will notify you by means appropriate to the significance of the change – for example, by email (to the address associated with your account) or by notice within the app/website. The “Last Updated” date at the top will indicate when the latest changes were made. Please review this Policy periodically to stay informed of how we are protecting your information. Your continued use of Fit-C after any update signifies acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy, to the extent permitted by law.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at the email or address provided above. We value your privacy and will address your inquiries as best as we can.</p>

   

    <h1>Fit-C Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction and Acceptance</h2>
    <p>Welcome to BJ Dhanvi Software Solutions Private Limited brand name Fit-C! These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern the use of Fit-C, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) fitness platform, including our websites and mobile applications for users, trainers, and fitness centres (collectively, the “Service” or “Platform”). By registering an account or accessing any part of Fit-C, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use our Service.</p>

    <p>These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and Fit-C (operated by BJ Dhanvi Software Solutions Private Limited., in India). Additional policies such as our Privacy Policy (which describes how we handle your personal data) are incorporated by reference. You are advised to read these Terms carefully. We may update the Terms periodically, and will notify you of major changes. Continued use of the Platform after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

    <p><strong>Key Definitions:</strong> In these Terms, “User” or “you” refers to anyone using the Fit-C User App (e.g. gym members or individual consumers). “Trainer” refers to fitness professionals using the Trainer Panel. “Centre” or “Fitness Centre” refers to gyms, studios, or other fitness business entities using the Centre Panel. “Fit-C” (or “we/“us”) refers to the company providing the Platform, including its affiliates and licensors. Trainers and Centres may collectively be referred to as “Service Providers” where applicable.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years of age to create an account as a User or Trainer on Fit-C. Individuals under 18 may only use Fit-C under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to these Terms on their behalf. By using the Platform, you represent that you meet the applicable age requirement. If registering on behalf of an organization (e.g. a gym business), you represent that you have the authority to agree to these Terms for that organization.</p>

    <p><strong>Health Requirements:</strong> You also represent that you have no medical condition that would make use of our fitness services unsafe. Because physical exercise and diet changes carry inherent risks, we strongly recommend you consult a doctor or healthcare professional before starting any new workout program or diet plan through Fit-C. The Platform and its content are not intended to diagnose, treat, or provide medical advice. You agree that you participate in workouts, classes, or diet programs through Fit-C at your own risk and that you have consulted a physician as needed to ensure these activities are appropriate for you.</p>

    <h2>3. Account Registration and Security</h2>
    <p>To use Fit-C&apos;s features, you will need to create an account and provide certain information. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration, including your name, valid contact information, and any other details we may require. You are responsible for keeping your account information updated. You may not impersonate someone else or create multiple active accounts for the same person.</p>

    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account login credentials. Do not share your password with others. You are liable for all activities conducted through your account. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or a security breach, you must notify Fit-C immediately. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to secure your account (however, you may be held responsible for losses incurred by us or others due to such failure). Fit-C reserves the right to suspend or terminate any account we suspect is being used in violation of these Terms or for fraudulent/illegal activity.</p>

    <h2>4. Services Overview</h2>
    <p>Fit-C provides a digital platform with three main modules: (a) a Centre Dashboard for fitness centres to manage operations and memberships; (b) a Trainer App/Portal for trainers to manage schedules and clients; and (c) a User App for end-users to receive workout and diet plans, book sessions, track progress, and engage in fitness challenges. Through Fit-C, Users can discover fitness centres and trainers, schedule in-person or online training sessions, receive personalized workout and nutrition recommendations (including AI-generated plans), make payments for memberships or classes, and participate in gamified fitness challenges.</p>

    <p><strong>Intermediary Role:</strong> Fit-C acts primarily as a technology platform that connects Users with independent fitness centres and trainers. Fit-C is not a gym, healthcare provider, or employer of trainers. The actual fitness services (training sessions, classes, advice, etc.) are provided by the Centres or Trainers, not by Fit-C itself. Fit-C&apos;s role is limited to facilitating the booking of sessions, enabling communication, and providing general fitness content and software tools. Any opinions, advice, or information offered by a Trainer or Centre (whether communicated through the Platform or during a session) are those of the respective provider and not of Fit-C. We do not guarantee the availability, suitability, or quality of any particular fitness centre, trainer, class, or exercise program.</p>

    <h2>5. User Responsibilities and Conduct</h2>
    <p>By accessing Fit-C, you agree to use the Platform only for its intended purposes and in accordance with these Terms and applicable laws. You must not:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Misuse the Service:</strong> You will not engage in any fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful activity on the Platform. This includes refraining from harassing others, posting offensive or infringing content, or using the Platform to promote unrelated products. You agree not to use Fit-C to stalk, intimidate, or harm any person.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Interfere with Operation:</strong> Do not attempt to disrupt or hack our systems. You must not introduce viruses, worms, or any malicious code, nor attempt to bypass security measures or access accounts/data that do not belong to you. Any such attempts may lead to termination and legal action.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Respect Intellectual Property:</strong> All content provided on the Platform (text, graphics, logos, software, and multimedia) is owned by or licensed to Fit-C. You may use this content for personal, non-commercial use only. Do not copy, distribute, modify, or create derivative works from our content without permission. Similarly, respect the content posted by other users or trainers – do not use it outside the Platform without consent.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>One Account Per User:</strong> You will maintain only one User account (and/or one Trainer account, if applicable) and will not create an account for someone else except as legally authorized (e.g., as a parent/guardian). You will not sell or transfer your account to another person.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Provide Accurate Information:</strong> You must not provide any information that is untrue or misleading. This applies to personal details, health information, payment data, and any content you contribute (like reviews or posts). If you discover information held by us is incorrect, you agree to correct it.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Follow Centre/Trainer Rules:</strong> When you attend a physical gym or class booked through Fit-C, you must abide by the rules and safety instructions of that facility or trainer. This includes any required health/safety protocols, proper use of equipment, and respectful behaviour towards staff and other members.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Fit-C reserves the right to monitor user activity on the Platform for compliance purposes. We may remove any content or restrict any account that violates these Terms or applicable laws. You understand that you are solely responsible for any content you post or actions you take on Fit-C, and you may be held liable for consequences of any violations.</p>

    <h2>6. User-Generated Content and License</h2>
    <p>Fit-C may offer features that allow users, trainers, or centres to create, upload, or share content (“User Content”), such as profile pictures, workout tips, comments, feedback, or social posts in community forums. By posting any User Content on our Platform, you affirm that: (a) you own or have obtained all necessary rights and permissions to share the content; and (b) such content does not violate any law or rights of any third party (including intellectual property, privacy, or publicity rights).</p>

    <p><strong>Prohibited Content:</strong> You agree not to post any content that is illegal, obscene, pornographic, hateful, defamatory, threatening, or otherwise objectionable. This includes content that incites violence, contains hate speech, or constitutes personal harassment. You also must not upload content containing viruses, malware, or that could harm the Platform&apos;s integrity. Fit-C has sole discretion to remove any content we deem violative of these standards or that adversely affects the user community.</p>

    <p><strong>License Grant to Fit-C:</strong> By submitting User Content, you grant Fit-C a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable license to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish, and display that content in connection with operating and promoting the Platform. For example, if you post a success story or review, you permit us to showcase it (along with your provided name/username and any images) on the Platform and our social media. This license survives even if you delete your account, but note that we will cease any new promotional uses of your content upon your account deletion. You retain ownership of your content; this license does not deprive you of your rights, only allows Fit-C to present the content to other users as intended.</p>

    <p><strong>Interaction and Recordings:</strong> If you participate in any live-streamed sessions or community events via Fit-C, you acknowledge that your image, video, or audio may be visible to others in the session (including the hosting trainer) and may be recorded for quality or replay purposes. For instance, a live group class might be recorded and made available as on-demand content – by joining, you consent to such recording and usage. Fit-C and its affiliates are granted the right to use such session footage as part of the service delivery, and you waive any claims to royalties or rights in this context.</p>

    <p>If you believe that another user&apos;s content infringes your legal rights (e.g. someone posted your photo without permission or is plagiarizing your material), please notify us via the Grievance Officer with details. We have a process in place for IP infringement claims and will take appropriate action, which may include removing content or disabling accounts of repeat infringers.</p>

    <h2>7. Platform Marketplace and Bookings</h2>
    <p>Fit-C enables a marketplace for fitness services and products: Users can book sessions (in-person or virtual) with trainers, sign up for classes or events at centres, purchase memberships, or buy fitness-related products listed by centres (e.g. merchandise, supplements). The following terms apply to such transactions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Bookings and Appointments:</strong> When you book a class or training session via Fit-C, that booking is a contract directly between you and the respective Centre/Trainer. Fit-C is not the provider of the class; we simply facilitate your reservation. It is the responsibility of the Centre or Trainer to honor the booking – including starting on time, providing the service as described, and handling any cancellations or rescheduling. Fit-C does not guarantee that any session will not be cancelled by the provider, but we will attempt to inform you of any changes. If a session you paid for is cancelled by the provider, Fit-C will assist in either rebooking you or processing a refund according to the provider&apos;s policy.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Centre/Trainer Policies:</strong> Every gym or trainer may have their own policies for cancellations, no-shows, or refunds. These should be made available to you (via their profile or during booking). It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with those policies. Fit-C is not liable for any disputes or dissatisfaction arising from a Centre&apos;s or Trainer&apos;s policies or services, such as refusal of a last-minute cancellation refund, the quality of the facility or training, or any other issues in execution. We act as an intermediary platform and cannot override a provider&apos;s terms for the services they offer.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Payments:</strong> You agree to pay all fees associated with the services you purchase through Fit-C. Prices for memberships, classes, personal training packages, or other purchasable items will be clearly displayed at the time of purchase. Unless stated otherwise, all payments are due immediately and are non-refundable. Fit-C may charge your provided payment method (credit card, UPI, etc.) for the amounts due, including any applicable taxes or platform fees. If your payment fails or is disputed (chargeback), we may suspend access to the related service and contact you for alternate payment. Persistent payment issues may result in account termination.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>In-App Purchases &amp; Subscriptions:</strong> Fit-C may offer premium features or content via in-app purchases or subscriptions (for example, an AI Trainer upgrade or a premium diet plan service). If you purchase a subscription through the mobile app, it may be processed by the app store provider (Apple or Google). Please note: For in-app subscriptions, billing and cancellation are handled by Apple or Google as per your app store account settings. Be aware of any auto-renewal terms – subscriptions will typically renew automatically unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. Refund requests for in-app purchases are subject to the app store&apos;s policies (Fit-C has limited ability to process refunds for purchases made through Apple/Google systems).</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Third-Party Payment Processors:</strong> For payments not made via app store billing, we use third-party payment gateways. By paying through these systems, you agree to their terms as well. Fit-C is not responsible for errors or security breaches on the part of those payment processors, but we choose reputable providers and will support you in resolving any issues to the extent possible. Payment disputes (e.g. suspected fraud) may result in us sharing transaction information with the payment processor or authorities as needed to resolve the issue.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Promotions and Trials:</strong> From time to time, Fit-C or its partners may offer promotional deals, free trials, or discount codes. These are subject to the specific terms of the promotion. Misuse of promotions (such as creating multiple accounts to claim a new-user discount) is prohibited and may result in cancellation of benefits or account suspension.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Relationships and Liability of Parties</h2>
    <p>Fit-C is not an employer of trainers, nor are we in a joint venture or partnership with fitness centres using our Platform. Trainers and Centres are independent providers. Users acknowledge that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>No Professional Advice from Fit-C:</strong> Any fitness or health-related information available through Fit-C (including AI-driven workout or diet plans, articles, or tips) is for general informational purposes. While we strive for accuracy and usefulness, it is not individualized medical or nutritional advice. Fit-C does not guarantee that following any workout or diet will result in specific outcomes. Always exercise common sense and consult professionals when needed. If you experience pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath during a workout, stop immediately and seek medical attention. Fit-C disclaims any liability for injuries or health issues you may experience when following exercises or diet suggestions on the Platform – you assume full responsibility for your choices and actions. The diets and fitness plans (whether AI-generated or created by a Trainer) are by nature general and may not be 100% tailored to every individual&apos;s specific needs; you should adapt them to your personal capacity and conditions.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Service Provider Responsibility:</strong> Any training services or wellness advice given by a Trainer or Centre (whether via chat, in person, or through content posted) is the responsibility of that Trainer or Centre. Fit-C does not warrant or certify the qualifications or expertise of any third-party Service Provider beyond basic verification. Users should use their independent judgment when choosing to follow advice or recommendations from a Trainer. To the fullest extent allowed by law, Fit-C disclaims all liability arising from your reliance on any information or suggestions provided by a Trainer or Centre through the Platform. This includes, but is not limited to, the safety, appropriateness, or effectiveness of a particular exercise, diet, regimen, or product recommendation.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>No Endorsement or Guarantee:</strong> The listing of a Trainer or Fitness Centre on Fit-C (such as in search results or a leaderboard) is generated by our system algorithms and user inputs. Such listings do not constitute an endorsement or recommendation by Fit-C. We make no guarantees about the exactness of any content (like profiles, ratings, or descriptions) or that services provided will meet your expectations. Any reviews or ratings are provided by other users, and while we may moderate blatant abuse, we do not verify every claim in user reviews.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>User and Provider Disputes:</strong> Fit-C is not a party to the contracts or agreements between Users and Trainers/Centres (except as a facilitator). In the event of a dispute or claim between you and a Trainer or Centre (for example, regarding poor service, injury during a session, misleading information, or fees charged), such disputes must be resolved between the parties involved. Fit-C may, at its discretion, assist by providing contact information or moderate communication, but we are not liable for any loss or damage arising out of issues between Users and third-party providers. This includes but is not limited to: no-shows or cancellation by the Trainer, facility conditions at a Centre, personal injuries sustained during sessions, or any misconduct by a Trainer, Centre staff, or User. Trainers and Centres are solely responsible for the services they provide, and Users are responsible for adhering to any instructions or terms of those providers.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Release:</strong> You agree that Fit-C will not be held responsible for any injury, accident, or health complication you might suffer as a result of using the Platform or attending a fitness session booked through the Platform. To the extent permitted by law, you release Fit-C and its affiliates from any claims or liability related to any such incidents. (This release does not apply to any claims arising from Fit-C&apos;s own negligence or willful misconduct; it pertains to the inherent risks of fitness activities and third-party interactions.)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Integrations</h2>
    <p>Fit-C integrates with various third-party services to enrich your experience. The following terms apply to specific integrations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Wearables and Health Apps:</strong> You may connect wearable devices or health apps (e.g., fitness trackers, smartwatches, Apple Health, Google Fit) to sync data with Fit-C. By doing so, you grant Fit-C permission to access and use the data those devices/apps share (such as step count, heart rate, sleep data) to provide insights, personalized recommendations, or track challenges. We will handle this data according to our Privacy Policy and in line with any platform rules (for example, we won’t use Apple HealthKit-derived data for marketing purposes without consent). You acknowledge that data from third-party devices might not always be accurate or up-to-date, and Fit-C is not responsible for errors or delays in syncing such data. If you notice discrepancies (like missing workout entries), you may need to check the third-party device/app.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Payment Gateways:</strong> Payments made through Fit-C (outside of app-store transactions) are processed by third-party payment gateways (e.g., Razorpay, PayPal, Stripe, etc.). These are beyond our control. While we choose secure and reputable processors, Fit-C is not liable for any security breaches or payment errors on the part of third-party processors. Any payment information you provide is submitted directly to those processors and subject to their terms. Fit-C typically does not receive your full financial information (such as card numbers) – we get a confirmation and transaction ID to record your purchase.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>External Links:</strong> The Platform or communications you receive (like newsletters or trainer profiles) may include links to third-party websites or resources. Fit-C provides these links for convenience and information. We do not endorse and are not responsible for content, advertising, products, or other materials on those external sites. If you choose to visit or engage with a third-party link, you do so at your own risk, and your relationship with that third party will be governed by their own terms.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All rights, title, and interest in and to the Fit-C Platform (including our software code, databases, trademarks, logos, design, and content we or our licensors provide) are the property of BJ Dhanvi Software Solutions Private Limited or its affiliates/licensors. The Platform is protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws.</p>

    <p>Fit-C grants you a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable license to use our app and website for your personal (or internal business) use, in accordance with these Terms. This license does not allow you to copy, distribute, modify, reverse engineer, or create derivative works of our software or content, except as explicitly permitted by law or with our written consent. You must not remove any proprietary notices or branding from the Platform.</p>

    <p>Any feedback, suggestions, or ideas you provide to Fit-C about our platform (“Feedback”) is completely voluntary. We are free to use such Feedback as we see fit and without any obligation to you – providing Feedback gives us a non-exclusive, perpetual license to implement and exploit it without restriction or compensation.</p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>Fit-C is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Fit-C disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the Platform will meet your requirements or achieve any specific results.</p>

    <p>In particular, while we aim for high availability and will endeavor to fix issues, we do not warrant that the Platform will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free. We do not guarantee the accuracy or reliability of any information obtained through the Platform (including data like calories burned, AI recommendations, or user-contributed content). You acknowledge that any reliance on such information is at your own discretion and risk.</p>

    <p>No advice or information (whether oral or written) obtained from Fit-C or through the Platform shall create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms. For example, communication with customer support or reading a fitness article on our blog does not guarantee any outcome or create a warranty.</p>

    <p>Fit-C does not warrant or endorse any third-party product or service advertised or offered through our Platform, or featured in any user content. Any dealings you have with third-party service providers or advertisers found on Fit-C are solely between you and that party.</p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Fit-C and its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, and agents (collectively, the “Fit-C Parties”) shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with your use of (or inability to use) the Platform, or any services or information obtained through the Platform. This includes, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of data, personal injury, or property damage, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

    <p>In particular, Fit-C will not be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Platform or your account or information contained therein. We also assume no liability for: (1) errors or inaccuracies of any content; (2) any personal injury or property damage resulting from your access to or use of the service; (3) any unauthorized access to our servers or personal data stored therein; (4) any interruption of transmission to or from the Platform; (5) any bugs, viruses, or harmful code transmitted through the Platform by any third party; or (6) any content or conduct of any third party on the Platform.</p>

    <p><strong>Maximum Liability:</strong> If, notwithstanding the above, any Fit-C Party is found liable to you for any claim or dispute arising under these Terms or your use of the Platform, the maximum aggregate liability we will owe you is limited to the amount (if any) you paid to us for the service in the past 12 months, or INR 10,000 (Indian Rupees) – whichever is lower. If you have not paid Fit-C any amounts in the period, we shall have no liability toward you for monetary damages. This limitation applies collectively to all claims and all kinds of liabilities (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise).</p>

    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you fully. In such cases, our liability will be limited to the smallest amount permitted by law.</p>

    <p><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> You acknowledge that you have a responsibility to use the Platform prudently. This includes consulting professionals when undertaking any fitness or health activities. You assume full responsibility for any loss or damage that results from your reliance on information or materials obtained from the Platform.</p>

    <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Fit-C and its officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates (“Indemnitees”) from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, demands, damages, expenses, or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your use or misuse of the Platform; (b) your violation of any of these Terms or any law or regulation; (c) your infringement of any rights of a third party (such as intellectual property, confidentiality, or privacy rights); or (d) any dispute or issue between you and any third party (including Trainers, Centres, or other users).</p>

    <p>Fit-C reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which case you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim. You shall not settle any such claim without our prior written consent unless the settlement releases Fit-C of all liability and does not impose any obligations on Fit-C.</p>

    <h2>14. Suspension and Termination</h2>
    <p>Fit-C may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate your access to the Platform (or certain features) at any time and for any reason, with or without notice. Common reasons for termination include: violation of these Terms, misuse of the Platform, illegal activities, or non-payment of fees. Upon termination, your right to use the Platform will cease immediately. We may delete your content or account data after termination, and you will have no right to any compensation or recourse for such deletion, except as required by applicable law or our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>You are free to stop using Fit-C or delete your account at any time. Any accrued rights and obligations (such as any payment due or indemnification commitments) will survive termination of your account. Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (such as Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, and Governing Law) shall continue to apply even after termination.</p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.</p>

    <p>In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Platform, the parties shall first attempt to resolve the dispute informally by contacting each other (you may reach out to our Grievance Officer as detailed in the Privacy Policy for dispute resolution). If we are unable to resolve the dispute amicably within a reasonable time, the following provisions will apply:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Subject to the arbitration clause below (if applicable), you agree that any legal action or proceeding concerning these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the courts or tribunals of competent jurisdiction in Hyderabad, Telangana, India, and you consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction by such courts.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Arbitration (if opted):</strong> Fit-C may elect to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Platform by binding arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. If arbitration is initiated, it will be conducted by a sole arbitrator appointed by Fit-C. The arbitration proceedings shall be held in [City], India, and the language of arbitration shall be English. The arbitral award shall be final and binding on the parties. Each party will bear its own costs of arbitration, and share the arbitrator&apos;s fees equally, unless the arbitrator decides otherwise. Importantly, you agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Injunctive Relief:</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, Fit-C reserves the right to seek injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our intellectual property, security, or data privacy rights.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>16. App Store Platform Terms</h2>
    <p>If you download or access the Fit-C mobile application via an app marketplace (such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store), you acknowledge and agree to the following platform-specific terms:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> These Terms are an agreement between you and Fit-C, not with Apple Inc. Apple is not responsible for the Fit-C app or its content. However, Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and, upon your acceptance of these Terms, have the right to enforce them against you as a third-party beneficiary. You also agree to comply with the App Store&apos;s terms of service when using the iOS app. In case of any failure of the Fit-C app to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple may refund any purchase price for the app to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the app. Any claims, losses, liabilities, or expenses attributable to any failure of the Fit-C app to conform to any warranty (if any were expressly made) are Fit-C&apos;s responsibility. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the app, including product liability claims, legal or regulatory compliance claims, consumer protection claims, or intellectual property infringement claims. If you have any questions or complaints about the app, you should contact Fit-C, not Apple.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Google Play Store:</strong> Similarly, if you obtained the app via Google Play, you acknowledge that Google bears no responsibility or liability for the app or its content. You must comply with Google Play&apos;s terms of service/use. Google is only a provider of the platform; any product support and maintenance is our responsibility. Google and its affiliates are third-party beneficiaries to these Terms if the app was downloaded through Google Play.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Third-Party Beneficiaries:</strong> Both Apple and Google (and their respective subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of this agreement, and have the right to enforce the Terms against you as such. No other third party is deemed a beneficiary.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>These platform terms do not confer any additional rights to you, but are disclosures required by the app store providers.</p>

    <h2>17. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms, along with the Privacy Policy and any other policies or guidelines incorporated by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and Fit-C regarding the use of our Service. They supersede any prior agreements or communications (whether oral or written) relating to the subject matter.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>No Waiver:</strong> Our failure to exercise or enforce any provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of that right or provision. Any waiver of any provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Fit-C.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Fit-C may freely assign these Terms (in whole or in part) as part of a merger, acquisition, sale of business, or by operation of law or otherwise, without any notice to you.</p>
      </li>
