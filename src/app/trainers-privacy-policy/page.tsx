         <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>BJ Dhanvi Software Solutions Private Limited with brand name Fit-C (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of personal data in compliance with Indian data protection laws, including the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect from trainers using the Fit-C Trainer Application (“Trainer App”), how we use and share it, and the rights available to you under applicable law. By using the Trainer App, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this Policy.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>Trainer Profile Data</h3>
  <p>When you register as a trainer, we collect personal information such as your name, contact details (email, phone number), age/date of birth (to verify you are an adult), professional qualifications/certifications, photos, and bio or experience details. We may also collect identity verification information (like government ID) as required by law or platform policy.</p>

  <h3>Usage Data</h3>
  <p>We collect information about how you use the Trainer App, such as login times, features accessed, and technical data (device type, OS, app version, IP address). This helps us monitor performance and improve our services.</p>

  <h3>Communication and Support</h3>
  <p>If you contact us or use in-app communications (for example, messaging with users or support chat), we collect records of those communications.</p>

  <h3>Location Data (if applicable)</h3>
  <p>With your permission, we may collect precise location data to support features like GPS check-in for home sessions or finding nearby fitness spaces.</p>

  <h3>User Client Data Access</h3>
  <p>The Trainer App allows you to access certain personal data of the clients you train (e.g. the users’ fitness metrics, workout progress, or biometric/health data). Note that this client data is provided by the users or their fitness centre and is made available to you strictly for training and coaching purposes. While you view or input updates to client data via the app, Fit-C stores this data on behalf of the client or Centre. This client-related data may include sensitive personal information such as health indicators (weight, BMI, heart rate, etc.). We require that you handle this information with strict confidentiality and in compliance with our Terms & Conditions and applicable privacy laws (see Section 6 below on Data Security and Section 8 on Your Responsibilities).</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>Fit-C uses the collected data for the following purposes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Providing Services</h4>
      <p>To operate the Trainer App and provide you with its core functionalities. For example, we use your profile information to create your trainer profile visible to your clients or prospective clients, schedule sessions, and facilitate communication with users. We use usage data to maintain your login session and personalize your dashboard.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Platform Operations and Improvements</h4>
      <p>To monitor, troubleshoot, and improve the Trainer App&apos;s functionality, performance, and user experience. For instance, usage patterns may be analyzed to introduce new features or enhance existing ones.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Facilitating Payments</h4>
      <p>If applicable, to facilitate any payments or payout calculations through the platform. (Note: Trainer earnings are typically disbursed through the associated fitness centre or via client payment transactions. Fit-C may process payment information as a conduit but does not directly employ or compensate trainers.)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Communications</h4>
      <p>To send you service-related communications such as session reminders, notifications from clients, app updates, changes to terms, or responses from support. We may also send promotional or educational content about new features, events, or best practices for trainers, but you can opt out of marketing emails if you prefer.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Analytics and Product Development</h4>
      <p>To use de-identified, aggregated data for analytics – for example, average training session lengths or popular training programs – in order to understand trends and improve our offerings. Any analytics or research use will not identify you personally.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Legal Compliance and Enforcement</h4>
      <p>To comply with legal obligations under Indian law (such as verifying trainer identity or qualifications if required) and to enforce our legal rights and policies. For example, we may use and retain certain data to investigate fraud, misuse, or violations of our terms, or to respond to lawful requests from authorities.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Disclosure of Information</h2>
  <p>Fit-C does not sell or rent your personal information. We only share information as needed to provide our services or as required by law, as detailed below:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>With Fitness Centres</h4>
      <p>If you are affiliated with or onboarded by a fitness centre (“Centre”) on Fit-C, we share your trainer profile and performance data with that Centre. For example, a Centre using the Fit-C dashboard can view details like your session schedules, client feedback, and relevant metrics, since they manage membership and trainer assignments. The Centre is responsible for handling any personal data they obtain and must do so in accordance with their own policies and the law (see Section 9 Data Stewardship for Centres).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>With Users/Clients</h4>
      <p>Your profile information (such as name, photo, qualifications, and ratings) will be visible to the users (clients) who interact with you through the platform. Users may also see certain activity information like available session slots or your responses on chat. No sensitive personal contact info (e.g., your phone or email) is shared with users through the app unless you choose to share it via chat or where required for session coordination (like enabling a video session link).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Service Providers</h4>
      <p>We employ trusted third-party service providers to perform functions on our behalf, in order to operate the platform. This includes cloud hosting providers (for data storage), communication providers (to send emails or SMS), analytics tools, and customer support software. These providers only receive information necessary to perform their services and are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for our specified purposes. We ensure that any data processor working with us also maintains appropriate security measures.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Legal Requirements and Safety</h4>
      <p>We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, court order, or governmental request, (ii) enforce our Terms & Conditions or other agreements, (iii) protect the rights, property, or safety of Fit-C, our users, or the public. For example, if law enforcement provides a lawful order to access certain data, or if a dispute arises and disclosure is needed to resolve it, we will comply as legally required.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Business Transfers</h4>
      <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of Fit-C or its assets, your personal data may be transferred to the successor or new owner as part of the business transfer. In such cases, we will ensure that the new entity continues to be bound by privacy safeguards with respect to your personal information, and we will notify you (for example, via email or a notice in the app) of any change in data handling.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>With Your Consent</h4>
      <p>Apart from the cases above, we will ask for your consent before sharing any of your personal information with third parties in scenarios that are not already covered by this Privacy Policy. For instance, if we ever want to feature your success story or profile in our marketing materials, we would only do so with your explicit permission.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
  <p><em>(Applicable for Web Panel users or cross-platform use)</em></p>
  <p>The Trainer App and associated web dashboard may use cookies or similar technologies to enhance user experience and gather usage data. Cookies are small text files placed on your device to remember your preferences or track activity. For example, a cookie may store your login token to keep you signed in on the web portal. We also may use analytic cookies or tools to understand how the app is used (e.g., which screens are most visited). You can control cookies through your browser settings, but note that disabling certain cookies might affect functionality (like staying logged in). For mobile app usage, analogous tracking (like mobile ad IDs or analytics SDKs) might collect usage patterns; however, no tracking is done that isn’t disclosed or that violates platform rules or your privacy rights. Refer to our Cookie Policy (if available) for more details on cookies and trackers.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take the security of your personal data very seriously. Fit-C implements reasonable security safeguards and industry best practices to protect data against unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. These measures include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Encryption</h4>
      <p>Sensitive personal data (such as passwords, health/biometric information of clients, etc.) is stored in encrypted form. Data transmission between the Trainer App and our servers is protected via HTTPS/TLS encryption.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Access Controls</h4>
      <p>Access to personal data is restricted on a need-to-know basis. Within Fit-C, only authorized personnel with valid business needs (such as support or IT) can access trainer or user data – and even then, subject to strict controls and confidentiality obligations. Trainers only have access to their own data and the data of their clients as permitted; each trainer&apos;s access is authenticated and limited to relevant information.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Secure Infrastructure</h4>
      <p>We host data on secure servers (using reputable cloud providers) with firewalls and monitoring systems to prevent intrusions. Regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing are conducted to strengthen our platform&apos;s defenses.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Baseline Security Policies</h4>
      <p>In line with legal requirements, we follow industry best standards for information security. We also ensure that any third-party service providers (data processors) we engage contractually uphold equivalent security measures and confidentiality.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Despite our best efforts, no security system is impenetrable. You should also take precautions, such as keeping your account credentials confidential and using a strong password. If you have reason to believe that your account or data is no longer secure (for example, if you suspect a breach or unauthorized access), please contact us immediately (see Section 10).</p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy or as required by law. In practical terms:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Trainer Account Data</h4>
      <p>Information associated with your trainer account (profile, qualifications, etc.) is kept as long as you maintain an active account. If you decide to terminate your trainer account, we will delete or anonymize your personal data within a reasonable time after account closure, unless retention is required for legal or regulatory reasons. For example, we may need to retain certain records for tax, audit, or dispute resolution purposes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Transaction and Usage Records</h4>
      <p>Data such as session logs, communications, and payout records may be retained for a certain period even after your account is inactive, particularly if such data is needed for legitimate business interests (e.g., accounting) or legal obligations. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act requires that personal data be erased when it is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was collected or when consent is withdrawn. Accordingly, we periodically review the data in our possession and erase or anonymize data that is no longer required.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Backup and Aggregated Data</h4>
      <p>Please note that removed data may persist in backups for a short duration (due to backup cycles), but will be purged according to our backup retention schedule. We may retain aggregated or anonymized data (which is not personally identifiable) indefinitely for analytics and product improvement. This aggregated data cannot be linked back to you or any individual.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you wish to close your account or request deletion of certain data, you may contact us (see Section 10). We will make efforts to comply with deletion requests in accordance with law and as outlined in Section 8 (Your Rights), but please be aware of the exceptions mentioned (such as legal retention requirements).</p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>As a data principal under Indian law, you have certain rights regarding your personal data. Fit-C is committed to honoring these rights. This section outlines your key rights and how you can exercise them:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Right to Access</h4>
      <p>You have the right to know what personal data we hold about you and to request a copy of that information. Through the Trainer App, you can view and update much of your basic profile information. You may also request a comprehensive report of your personal data by contacting us. We will provide this unless restricted by law or it infringes on others’ rights.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Right to Correction</h4>
      <p>If any of your personal information is inaccurate or out-of-date, you have the right to request correction or update. You can directly edit certain details in your profile. For other fields or if you need assistance, contact us and we will help rectify any incorrect data to ensure it is accurate and up to date.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Right to Deletion</h4>
      <p>You may request deletion of your personal data when it is no longer necessary for the purpose it was collected or if you withdraw consent (in cases where consent is the basis for processing). For example, if you discontinue using the platform, you can request that we delete your account and related data. We will evaluate such requests in line with legal requirements – if no lawful basis for retaining the data exists, we will delete it. Note that certain data may be retained after deletion request if required by law (e.g., financial transaction records) or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. We will inform you if any such exception applies.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Right to Withdraw Consent</h4>
      <p>Where we rely on your consent to process data (for instance, optional marketing emails or accessing device location), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing done before withdrawal. If you withdraw consent for a necessary function (like location for a location-based service), some features may not function properly. We will inform you of any consequences at the time you withdraw consent.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Right to Grievance Redressal</h4>
      <p>Under the DPDP Act, you have the right to have your grievances or concerns addressed in a timely manner. If you have any complaints about how your data is handled, you can contact our Grievance Officer (see Section 10). We will acknowledge and resolve complaints within the timelines prescribed by law. If you are not satisfied with our resolution, you may have the option to escalate the complaint to the Data Protection Board of India or other appropriate authority.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Choices – Marketing and Notifications</h4>
      <p>You have control over how we communicate with you. You can opt out of non-essential communications – for example, you can unsubscribe from marketing/promotional emails by following the link in those emails. For in-app notifications, you can manage certain preferences in the app settings (though administrative or service notifications may be necessary for us to send). On your device, you can control push notification permissions through your settings.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>To exercise any of the above rights, please contact us via the methods in Section 10. We may need to verify your identity (to ensure that the person making the request is you or an authorized representative) before fulfilling the request. We will respond to your requests within a reasonable timeframe and as required by law. Please note that some rights may be subject to exceptions or limitations under applicable law; we will inform you if any such provisions apply.</p>

  <h2>9. Trainer Responsibilities – Data Confidentiality</h2>
  <p>As a trainer on the Fit-C platform, you may have access to personal and sensitive data about users (your clients) including health and biometric information. We emphasize that you have a duty to handle all user data with the utmost confidentiality and care:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Use for Intended Purpose Only</h4>
      <p>You may use client personal data only for the purpose of providing training and wellness services to that client via the Fit-C platform. Any use of data beyond this scope – such as using a client&apos;s contact information for unsolicited marketing, or sharing their workout or health information with third parties – is strictly prohibited without explicit consent from the client and authorization from Fit-C.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>No Unauthorized Disclosure</h4>
      <p>You must not disclose, share, or leak any personal information of users that you access through Fit-C. This includes refraining from downloading or exporting user data outside the platform interface, and not discussing or revealing a client&apos;s identity, health metrics, or other personal details to others (except to the extent the client themselves has consented or made such information public).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Data Protection Compliance</h4>
      <p>You are expected to comply with all applicable data protection laws and Fit-C&apos;s policies when handling user data. Under India&apos;s data protection regime, personal data (especially any health/biometric data) should be treated with care. While Fit-C as a platform implements security safeguards, you as a trainer should also take precautions like keeping your app login secure, not leaving your device unattended while logged in, and reporting any suspected breach. If a user entrusts you with additional personal information (e.g., they share medical conditions or goals with you in confidence), you should treat that information as highly sensitive.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Immediate Notification of Breach</h4>
      <p>If you become aware of any unauthorized access or disclosure of user data, or if your device with the Trainer App is lost or stolen, you must immediately notify Fit-C so that we can take appropriate measures (such as disabling your account, assisting in remote logout, and fulfilling any breach notification duties we have).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Consequences of Misuse</h4>
      <p>Misuse of personal data or violation of confidentiality obligations can lead to serious consequences, including suspension or termination of your trainer account, and potential legal action by Fit-C, the affected individuals, or regulators. Indian law imposes penalties for unauthorized use or sharing of personal data, especially sensitive data, and Fit-C will cooperate with enforcement of such rules.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>By respecting users’ privacy and following these guidelines, you contribute to a trusted environment on the platform. For more details, please refer to the Trainer Terms & Conditions and our internal policies/training (if provided). If you have any doubts about what is permissible regarding user data, please err on the side of caution and consult us for clarification.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact Us and Grievance Officer</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy or the handling of your personal data, please reach out to us. We have appointed a Grievance Officer as per legal requirements to address data protection queries and issues. You can contact us at:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Grievance Officer:</strong></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Email:</strong></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Postal Address:</strong></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Contact Number:</strong></p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will strive to respond to and resolve your queries or complaints at the earliest, and in any event within any timeframe prescribed by law. If you contact us by email, please include “Privacy Inquiry” or “Data Request” in the subject line to help us address it promptly.</p>

  <h2>11. Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. When we make material changes, we will notify you by appropriate means – for example, by posting the updated policy in the app and on our website, and/or by sending a notice to the email address associated with your account. The “Last Updated” date at the top indicates when the latest changes were made. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. Your continued use of the Trainer App after any update constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy.</p>

  <hr/>

  <h1>Fit-C Trainer Application – Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>

  <h2>1. Introduction and Acceptance</h2>
  <p>These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern the access and use of the Fit-C Trainer Application and related services (“Trainer App”) by you as a trainer (“Trainer” or “you”). By registering for or using the Trainer App, you agree to be bound by these Terms, as well as our Privacy Policy (which is incorporated herein by reference). If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you should not use the Trainer App. BJ Dhanvi Software Solutions Private Limited with brand name (“Fit-C,” “we,” or “us”) reserves the right to update or modify these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of major changes (for example, via an in-app notification or email). Your continued use of the Trainer App after changes are notified will constitute acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

  <h2>2. Platform Role of Fit-C</h2>
  <p>Fit-C provides a technology platform (including the Trainer App, user app, and centre dashboard) that connects trainers, fitness centres, and end users (trainees/clients). Fit-C is a software intermediary, not a fitness service provider or employer. You understand and acknowledge that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Independent Service Provider</h4>
      <p>Using the Fit-C platform does not create any employment, agency, or partnership relationship between you and Fit-C. You are engaging with clients either independently or through a fitness centre, and you provide your training services as an independent professional. Fit-C does not direct or control how you deliver your services or exercise your expertise, and we do not provide the training or fitness services ourselves.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>No Employment Benefits</h4>
      <p>Since you are not an employee of Fit-C, you are not entitled to any employee benefits from Fit-C. You are solely responsible for any taxes, insurance, or registrations applicable to your work as a trainer. Fit-C will not withhold or pay any income tax, social security, unemployment, or workers compensation on your behalf. You are advised to fulfill your own obligations for reporting income and paying taxes as required by law. If, notwithstanding this understanding, any government authority or court were to find that Fit-C should have been treating you as an employee or is liable for any employment-related obligations, you agree to indemnify and reimburse Fit-C for any costs, fees or liabilities incurred as a result (see Section 10 on Indemnity).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>No Guarantees of Business or Income</h4>
      <p>Fit-C does not guarantee any minimum number of clients, sessions, or earnings to you. Platform features like client discovery or session bookings are available to facilitate your business, but the results depend on many factors (including your expertise, client demand, and centre arrangements). You acknowledge that any training engagements you enter are between you and the client (and/or the Centre managing the client), and not with Fit-C. We are not responsible for the performance of clients (e.g., whether they attend sessions or follow programs) or for disputes between you and any client or Centre, though we may assist in platform-related issues.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Trainer Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>
  <p>To use the Trainer App, you must meet the following eligibility criteria and agree to the account registration terms:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Minimum Age</h4>
      <p>You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to register as a Trainer. By registering, you represent that you are legally an adult capable of entering into contracts.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Qualifications</h4>
      <p>You should possess relevant fitness or coaching qualifications or experience as typically expected in the fitness industry. While Fit-C may not require proof for basic platform access, certain Centres or users may prefer or require certified trainers. We reserve the right to request verification of your identity, qualifications, certifications, or background as part of onboarding or at any later time. You agree to provide truthful information and documents if requested, and understand that misrepresentation of your qualifications or identity can lead to suspension or termination of your account.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Account Creation</h4>
      <p>When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information, including your name, contact information, and any profile details. You will choose a username and password (or use an OTP and phone/email combination) for login. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials. Do not share your account or credentials with anyone else. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or a security breach, you must notify Fit-C immediately so we can help secure your account.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Affiliation with Centre</h4>
      <p>If you are joining the platform via an invitation or onboarding by a fitness Centre (gym/studio), your account may be linked to that Centre&apos;s account. In such cases, the Centre administrators can view and manage certain aspects of your profile (like your schedule or assigned clients) through their dashboard. You acknowledge and consent to this arrangement. If you later cease to be affiliated with that Centre, please inform us so we can update your account status (or the Centre may do so). You may also operate as an independent trainer on the platform, subject to any additional requirements Fit-C may impose for independent trainers (e.g., payment setup, verification checks).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Single Account</h4>
      <p>You may maintain only one Trainer account in your name. Having multiple accounts is not permitted unless explicitly approved by Fit-C (for example, if you legitimately train in very distinct domains requiring separate profiles). We reserve the right to merge or deactivate duplicate accounts.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Profile Content</h4>
      <p>You are responsible for the content you upload or display in your profile (such as your bio, photos, specialization, certifications, etc.). Ensure that any content you provide is accurate, not misleading, and does not violate any third-party rights or any laws (including intellectual property rights – see Section 5). Fit-C reserves the right to review, approve, or remove profile content that we find inappropriate or in violation of these Terms or any policies.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Use of the Trainer App</h2>
  <p>Fit-C grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Trainer App and its tools, solely for purposes of providing training/coaching services to clients through the Fit-C platform, in accordance with these Terms and any usage guidelines provided. Your use of the app must adhere to the following rules:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Compliance with Laws and Policies</h4>
      <p>You agree to use the Trainer App in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and with our platform rules. This includes data protection laws (when handling personal data of users), copyright laws (when uploading or sharing content), and any health &amp; safety regulations relevant to fitness coaching. You also agree to follow any code of conduct or community guidelines that Fit-C may provide for interacting with clients (for example, anti-harassment policies, appropriate content standards, etc.).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Professional Conduct</h4>
      <p>You will maintain a high standard of professionalism in all interactions through the platform. This means treating clients respectfully, not engaging in abusive, discriminatory, or inappropriate behavior, and providing services to the best of your abilities. If you use in-app chat or communication features, you must not send spam, offensive messages, or attempt to solicit clients off-platform in a manner that circumvents any platform policies or fees.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>No Unauthorized Use</h4>
      <p>You shall not misuse the platform or attempt to interfere with its proper working. This includes, without limitation: not engaging in any hacking, scanning, or vulnerability testing of our systems; not introducing any malware or harmful code; and not performing any actions that impose an unreasonable load on our infrastructure. Also, you must not use the Trainer App to do anything unlawful – for example, you must not use the platform to sell unrelated products, run fraudulent schemes, or any activity that is not related to fitness training services.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Device and Access</h4>
      <p>You are responsible for having compatible hardware or devices and internet connectivity to use the app. We are not liable for any data charges or device issues you might face. You must not use any automated means (such as bots or scripts) to access the platform, except via official Fit-C provided APIs or integrations (if any, and only with permission).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Updates</h4>
      <p>Fit-C may release updates, bug fixes, or new versions of the Trainer App. It is your responsibility to install updates promptly to ensure proper functioning and security. Failure to update may result in certain features not working or security vulnerabilities for which we cannot be responsible. We may automatically update the app in some cases.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Service Modifications</h4>
      <p>Fit-C reserves the right to modify or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) the Trainer App or certain features at any time. We strive to give advance notice for major changes, but there may be instances where notice is not practical. We are not liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the platform, but if you are adversely affected, you can reach out to discuss possible remedies (for instance, if a paid feature is discontinued, we may consider refunds as applicable).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Third-Party Integrations</h4>
      <p>If the Trainer App integrates with any third-party services or content (for example, pulling in YouTube videos, maps, etc.), your use of those third-party elements may be subject to their terms and privacy policies. Fit-C is not responsible for third-party services; use them at your discretion and risk.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Content and Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>This section addresses ownership of content and intellectual property (IP) rights for both Fit-C and you as a user of the platform:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Fit-C Intellectual Property</h4>
      <p>The Trainer App (and all Fit-C platforms) contain content and technology that is owned by or licensed to Fit-C, including software code, design elements, logos, trademarks, text, graphics, and databases. Fit-C retains all rights, title, and interest in and to its intellectual property. You are not granted ownership of any part of the platform; only a right to use it per these Terms. You must not attempt to copy, reverse engineer, modify, create derivative works of, or distribute any part of our software or content, except as allowed by law or with our explicit written permission. You cannot use “Fit-C” or our logos in any way that misrepresents yourself or implies endorsement, without written permission.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Your Content</h4>
      <p>As a Trainer, you may input or upload content to the platform – for example, profile photographs, descriptions, workout plans, diet charts, session notes, or even community posts if those features exist. You remain the owner of the intellectual property in your content. However, by providing content on the platform, you grant Fit-C a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, display, adapt, and distribute your content as necessary to operate the service. This license is limited to purposes such as displaying your profile and plans to your clients, processing and storing your notes, or promoting the services (for instance, using a snapshot of a well-designed workout plan template in a blog post about our platform – but if we do anything like that, we will try to inform you or anonymize the content). We will not sell your personal content to third parties or use it outside the scope of providing and improving the Fit-C platform without seeking additional permission.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Content Guidelines</h4>
      <p>You represent and warrant that any content you upload: (i) is accurate (where it states facts or your credentials), (ii) is genuinely yours to share (you either own it or have the rights to use it – e.g., you&apos;re not uploading someone else&apos;s copyrighted workout video without permission), and (iii) does not violate any law or rights of others. Do not upload content that is defamatory, obscene, infringing, or otherwise objectionable. Fit-C is not obligated to pre-screen content, but we reserve the right to remove or disable access to any content that violates these Terms or rights of others, or that we deem inappropriate. We may also suspend or terminate accounts that repeatedly infringe intellectual property rights or post unlawful content.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Third-Party IP</h4>
      <p>When using the platform, you must respect intellectual property rights of third parties. For example, if you incorporate a popular music track or a copyrighted diet plan into materials you share with a client via our chat or uploads, ensure you have the legal right to do so. You shall indemnify Fit-C for any claims arising from your infringement of third-party IP (see Section 10). Fit-C will likewise handle claims that the platform itself infringes third-party IP – if any such issues are brought to our attention, we will address them and, if necessary, may remove or alter content or features to resolve the infringement. If you notice any IP infringement on the platform, report it to us.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Feedback</h4>
      <p>We welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you choose to send us any feedback, ideas, or suggestions, you agree that Fit-C is free to use them without any restriction or compensation to you, and that you waive any claim to intellectual property rights in those ideas. This helps us incorporate improvements quickly and fairly.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Payments and Fees</h2>
  <p>This section describes how financial transactions involving trainers are handled on the Fit-C platform:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Trainer Earnings and Payouts</h4>
      <p>Fit-C itself is not the direct employer or payer of trainers, but our platform facilitates payment flows in the ecosystem. If you are affiliated with a Centre, the Centre will be responsible for paying you your wages or fees for sessions (this could be in the form of a salary, hourly pay, or per-session commission, depending on your arrangement with the Centre). Fit-C&apos;s system may assist the Centre by calculating your payout (e.g., via the trainer payout automation feature) and showing you a statement of sessions or commissions, but Fit-C does not guarantee the Centre&apos;s payment obligations. Any disputes over payment amount or timing between you and the Centre should be resolved directly with that Centre, though we can assist by providing logs or data from the system if needed.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Independent Trainers</h4>
      <p>If you are offering services independently on Fit-C&apos;s marketplace (i.e., not under a specific gym&apos;s umbrella), then Fit-C may facilitate client payments to you. For example, when a user books a home or online session with you via the app, the user might pay through the Fit-C platform. In such cases, Fit-C (or its payment gateway partner) will collect the payment from the user on your behalf. Fit-C will deduct any applicable service fee or commission (which will be communicated to you in advance, e.g., a percentage of the session fee to cover platform costs) and remit the remaining amount to you. You will need to provide us with valid payout details (such as a bank account or digital wallet info) and complete any required KYC (Know Your Customer) verification for compliance. We will strive to remit payouts in a timely manner (e.g., on a weekly or monthly schedule, subject to any minimum threshold and after subtracting fees). Note: If a user demands a refund or if a chargeback occurs for a session you provided (e.g., due to service not delivered or other issues), Fit-C reserves the right to offset that refunded amount from your payout or future earnings, after a fair investigation.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Platform Fees</h4>
      <p>Currently, downloading and using the Trainer App is free for trainers in terms of subscription. Fit-C primarily charges the Centres (through subscription fees) and/or takes a commission from revenue streams (like the aforementioned marketplace bookings or event fees). If Fit-C ever introduces a direct fee for trainers (for example, a premium subscription for additional features or a lead generation fee), we will inform you and obtain consent for any charges. You will never be charged without your explicit agreement to the fees.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Taxes</h4>
      <p>You are responsible for determining any taxes (such as income tax or GST if applicable for your services) that apply to your earnings and for remitting those taxes to the appropriate authorities. Fit-C&apos;s payout statements to you will generally be gross of any such taxes unless we explicitly state otherwise. However, if we are required by law to withhold any tax (for instance, TDS under Indian tax law, or any withholding for foreign trainers if applicable), we will deduct those amounts before payout and provide appropriate documentation to you. We will clearly communicate with you if any such withholding is required.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Payment Gateway and Delays</h4>
      <p>Payments facilitated through the platform rely on third-party payment processors. There may be occasional delays or issues outside our control (such as bank holidays, processor downtime, or user payment failures). Fit-C is not liable for delays in payment processing that are due to third-party systems, but we will do our best to help resolve any issues. It&apos;s important that you provide accurate payment details to avoid failed payouts. Fit-C is not responsible for payments sent to a wrong account due to incorrect details you provided (until the funds are returned and can be reprocessed).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Changes to Payment Terms</h4>
      <p>Fit-C may change the commission rates, fee structures, or payout schedules in the future. Any such changes will be communicated to you with reasonable advance notice (e.g., via email or in-app notification). If you continue to use the platform or accept bookings after the effective date of fee changes, that constitutes acceptance of the new terms. If you do not agree, you may cease using the platform (and if relevant, withdraw any available earnings before leaving).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Transparency</h4>
      <p>We aim to keep all financial calculations transparent. The Trainer App or dashboard will show you a breakdown of your completed sessions, earnings, and any deductions (such as commission or tax withheld). If you believe there is an error in the payout calculation, you must notify us within a reasonable time so we can review and rectify if needed.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Data Privacy and Confidentiality</h2>
  <p>Protection of personal data is extremely important on our platform. As a Trainer, you must handle data responsibly, and Fit-C also has obligations towards your data. Please note the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Your Personal Data</h4>
      <p>Fit-C will collect and process your personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable law. This includes sharing certain data with Centres or users as described in the Privacy Policy. By using the Trainer App, you consent to such processing and you agree that the data you provide is accurate. You also agree to the transfer or storage of your data on our servers which may be located within India or in other jurisdictions as permitted by law (ensuring adequate protection).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>User Data Access</h4>
      <p>You will have access to personal data of users/clients through the Trainer App (for example, their name, contact, and fitness statistics). You must treat this data as confidential and use it only for legitimate purposes of serving that user within the platform. Do not download, screenshot, or store user personal data outside the Fit-C app. Do not share it with third parties. If you keep any notes or data about a user externally (e.g., a personal notebook), ensure no sensitive personal information is recorded insecurely. In essence, respect users’ privacy as you would expect yours to be respected.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Compliance with Data Protection Laws</h4>
      <p>You undertake to comply with Indian data protection laws when handling personal information through Fit-C. This includes the obligations under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 regarding confidentiality, purpose limitation, and data security. For instance, any health or biometric information about individuals should be handled with care, and you should not use it for purposes to which the individual has not consented. Fit-C has obtained consent from users for processing their data on our platform, and by extension, that allows you to process it for the intended service. You must not process user data in ways that the user did not agree to.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Platform Data Security</h4>
      <p>We have implemented technical safeguards in the app (such as login authentication and role-based access) to protect data. You must also do your part: keep your login credentials secure, update the app to benefit from security patches, and report any incidents. If you suspect any personal data (yours or a user&apos;s) has been compromised, notify Fit-C immediately so we can act (for example, by informing affected data principals and authorities as required).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Confidential Information of Fit-C</h4>
      <p>In the course of using the platform, you might gain access to certain non-public information related to Fit-C&apos;s business (for example, you might be testing a beta feature or see internal metrics). Any non-public information about Fit-C&apos;s systems, algorithms, or plans is considered Fit-C&apos;s confidential information. You agree not to disclose such information to any third party without our consent.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Exceptions</h4>
      <p>The obligations of confidentiality do not apply to information that is or becomes publicly available through no breach of your own, or information that you obtain lawfully from someone else who is free to share it, or information that you independently develop without reference to confidential info. If you are required by law or a court order to disclose certain data, you may do so, provided you give notice to us (if legally allowed) so we have a chance to object or seek protection.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Survival</h4>
      <p>These privacy and confidentiality obligations continue even after you stop using the Trainer App. You should return or delete any confidential information of others (including user data or Fit-C data) in your possession upon termination of your use of the platform.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. No Warranties by Fit-C</h2>
  <p>Fit-C strives to provide a reliable and high-quality platform, but we need to make clear certain warranty disclaimers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>“As-Is” Basis</h4>
      <p>The Trainer App and all related services are provided to you on an “as is” and “as available” basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. Fit-C does not guarantee that the platform will be error-free, uninterrupted, or meet all your expectations. We do not make any promises regarding the amount of business you will achieve through the platform or the actions of users or Centres.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>No Warranty on Outcomes</h4>
      <p>Any fitness or health outcomes for your clients, or your business outcomes (like revenue), depend on a variety of factors outside our control. Fit-C makes no warranty or representation that the use of the platform will directly result in specific outcomes (e.g., improved client retention or any health benefits). The platform is a tool to assist you, and it remains your responsibility to deliver services professionally.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Quality and Data</h4>
      <p>We do not warrant the accuracy or completeness of any data or content provided through the app (for instance, user-provided information, or analytics and suggestions offered by our AI Chatbot or algorithms). You should use professional judgment in relying on any information from the platform. The AI-based insights, if any, are for supplementary use and come without guarantee of accuracy or appropriateness for every situation.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Security and Bugs</h4>
      <p>While we employ security measures, we do not warrant that the service will be secure or free from vulnerabilities or viruses. You assume the risks associated with internet usage. We encourage you to use up-to-date antivirus and take necessary precautions. Fit-C will not be liable for any loss or corruption of data, or any damage to your device, that occurs in connection with downloading or using the app, except as caused by our negligence or willful default.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Third-Party Services</h4>
      <p>If the Trainer App integrates or allows access to any third-party services (like a video conferencing tool, payment gateway, or content library), Fit-C makes no warranty as to those services. Your use of third-party services may be subject to that third party&apos;s terms and privacy policy, and any warranty or issue will be as per your arrangement with them. We don’t guarantee third-party services will function without disruption or error when integrated with our platform.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Fit-C&apos;s liability to you is limited. This section is important and affects your legal rights, so please read it carefully:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>No Indirect Damages</h4>
      <p>In no event will Fit-C or its affiliates, officers, employees, or agents be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with your use of (or inability to use) the Trainer App or our services. This includes, without limitation, any loss of revenue or profits, loss of data, loss of business opportunities, or injury to reputation, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. For example, we are not liable if a system outage causes you to miss a session booking and you claim lost income; likewise, we aren’t liable for consequences of any fitness advice given, as that advice is coming from you as the trainer, not from Fit-C.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Cap on Liability</h4>
      <p>To the extent we are found liable to you for any claims arising out of these Terms or the use of the platform (whether in contract, tort, negligence, or otherwise), our total liability shall not exceed the amount of service fees you have paid to Fit-C (if any) in the six (6) months preceding the claim, or INR 5,000, whichever is greater. This limitation applies cumulatively to all claims. If, for instance, you have paid no direct fees to Fit-C (because the service is free for trainers or fees are paid by others), then our maximum liability would be limited to INR 5,000.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Centre/User Actions</h4>
      <p>Fit-C is not liable for the actions or omissions of any Centre or end user on the platform. We serve as a platform provider. Any obligations regarding membership, training facilities, or payments that a Centre has to you, or any personal injury or property damage that occurs in a session, are primarily the responsibility of the parties involved (the Centre, the user, and potentially you). Fit-C does not assume liability for disputes or incidents that arise in the course of the actual fitness training or use of a Centre&apos;s facilities. However, this clause does not affect any claim a consumer (user) might have against you or the Centre; it simply clarifies that Fit-C isn’t liable for those.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Exceptions</h4>
      <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or limitations of liability. Nothing in these Terms will exclude or limit liability that cannot be limited by law – for example, liability for death or personal injury caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct, or liability for fraud. However, such liabilities are extremely unlikely to involve Fit-C since we do not directly supervise training sessions.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Release</h4>
      <p>You agree that if you have a dispute with any user or Centre or other third party arising out of your use of the platform, you release Fit-C (and our affiliates and personnel) from all claims, demands, and damages connected with such disputes. We only intervene in disputes at our discretion, to facilitate a resolution, but we are not obligated to do so.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Fit-C and its affiliates, and each of our respective directors, officers, employees, and agents, from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that arise out of or are related to: (a) your use or misuse of the Trainer App or the services; (b) your breach of any of these Terms or of any representation or warranty herein; (c) your violation of any law or regulation or the rights of any third party (for example, any intellectual property infringement or data privacy violation by you); or (d) any dispute or issue between you and any Centre or client (including any personal injury, property damage, or contract dispute that occurs during or related to a training session).</p>

  <p>For instance, if a client claims that your training advice caused them injury, and they bring a claim against Fit-C as well as you, you will indemnify Fit-C for our legal defense and any resulting liability, because that issue arose from your conduct as a trainer. Similarly, if you improperly disclose a user&apos;s private health information and there&apos;s a regulatory penalty or lawsuit, you would cover Fit-C&apos;s costs since you breached your obligations.</p>

  <p>Fit-C will: (i) promptly notify you of any such claim (provided that failure to do so only relieves you of your responsibility to the extent it prejudices your ability to defend the claim), and (ii) cooperate with you (at your expense) in defending such claim. You may choose legal counsel to defend the claim, subject to our right to approve counsel (not to be unreasonably withheld). We reserve the right, at our option, to assume exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you – in which case you agree to cooperate with our defense of that claim and we will assume the indemnification costs. This indemnity obligation will survive any termination of your use of the Trainer App or these Terms.</p>

  <h2>11. Termination</h2>
  <p>Both you and Fit-C have the right to terminate this agreement under certain conditions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Your Right to Terminate</h4>
      <p>You may stop using the Trainer App at any time and may terminate your account by giving notice to Fit-C (for example, by using an account deletion feature or contacting support). If you are affiliated with a Centre, you might also inform the Centre to ensure any separate contractual obligations are handled. Upon your request, we will deactivate your profile and remove or anonymize personal data as described in the Privacy Policy (subject to retention required by law).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Fit-C&apos;s Right to Terminate or Suspend</h4>
      <p>Fit-C may suspend or terminate your Trainer account, or your access to certain features, at any time with or without cause, with reasonable notice to you. In particular, we may do so if you breach these Terms or any applicable policies, if we receive serious complaints about you from users or a Centre, or if we suspect fraudulent or harmful activity. In cases of severe violation or illegal conduct, we may terminate or suspend immediately without prior notice. For less severe issues, we will attempt to provide notice and an opportunity to explain or correct the issue.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Effect of Termination</h4>
      <p>Upon termination of your account, whether by you or us, your right to access the Trainer App will cease. You must stop using any of Fit-C&apos;s apps and return (or delete) any confidential information or data you have from the platform. We will settle any outstanding legitimate payouts to you (if you had independent client bookings that were completed) after resolving any deductions for refunds or claims. Any provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination (such as indemnity, limitation of liability, confidentiality, and intellectual property provisions) shall survive. If your account was terminated due to breach on your part, we reserve the right to notify relevant parties (like affected users or Centres, or law enforcement if appropriate) about the termination and reasons, especially if it involves trust and safety concerns.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Reinstatement</h4>
      <p>If appropriate and if the issues leading to suspension can be cured, we may restore your account after you have taken corrective actions. However, Fit-C is not obligated to reinstate accounts and this will be at our discretion based on the situation.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Termination of Platform or Services</h4>
      <p>Separately, Fit-C reserves the right to discontinue the Trainer App or the platform entirely (for all users) at any time, hopefully never needed. If that were to happen, we would provide notice to all trainers and Centres in advance, and these Terms would terminate with respect to everyone upon platform shutdown. Trainers would be responsible for making alternative arrangements with their clients outside the platform in such a case.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Responsibility for Workouts, Training, and Fitness Advice</h2>
  <p>The Trainer acknowledges and agrees that any and all workout plans, training sessions, fitness consultations, dietary recommendations, and wellness guidance provided to Users through the Fit-C Platform are independently created and delivered by the Trainer based on their personal expertise, qualifications, and professional judgment.</p>

  <p>Fit-C does not supervise, verify, or endorse the suitability, accuracy, or safety of any fitness regimen or health advice provided by Trainers. The Trainer shall exercise due care and professional diligence in assessing a User&apos;s medical history, physical capabilities, and individual health conditions before recommending or conducting any training activities.</p>

  <p>In the event that a User suffers any physical injury, medical complication, psychological impact, or health-related issue arising from or allegedly related to the services rendered by the Trainer, Fit-C shall bear no responsibility or liability whatsoever. Any and all such disputes, claims, or liabilities shall be resolved exclusively between the Trainer and the User, and the Trainer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Fit-C against any third-party claims, damages, or legal consequences resulting therefrom.</p>

  <h2>13. AI-Powered Engagement &amp; Event Marketplace Participation</h2>
  <p>The Trainer may opt-in to participate in Fit-C&apos;s AI-Driven Chatbot and Event Marketplace Modules. These features enable Trainers to enhance visibility, receive AI-generated user recommendations, and list paid group sessions, bootcamps, challenges, or other fitness events.</p>

  <p>The Trainer understands that Fit-C&apos;s AI modules operate based on historical user data, platform behavior analytics, and predefined recommendation algorithms. While the AI may recommend Trainers to Users or vice versa, Fit-C assumes no responsibility for the outcome, efficacy, or appropriateness of such automated interactions.</p>

  <p>Any training, advice, or services rendered as a result of AI-based matches or recommendations shall be considered as provided solely under the Trainer&apos;s discretion and professional authority, and not as services prescribed or endorsed by Fit-C.</p>

  <p>Trainers who list events in the Fit-C Event Marketplace are solely responsible for service quality, user safety, pricing accuracy, event delivery, venue compliance, and customer satisfaction. Fit-C acts merely as a technology intermediary and shall not be held liable for any disputes, injuries, cancellations, or damages arising from such events.</p>

  <p>The Trainer agrees to comply with all applicable laws, local regulations, and industry standards while conducting any training or hosting events through the platform, and shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Fit-C against any legal or financial liability arising from such activities.</p>

  <h2>14. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <h4>Governing Law</h4>
  <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Specifically, since Fit-C operates in India, core statutes like the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and Information Technology Act, 2000 (and rules made thereunder), as well as relevant state laws, will apply to the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement.</p>

  <h4>Arbitration</h4>
  <p>In the event of any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Trainer App, the parties shall first attempt to resolve it amicably through good-faith negotiation. If we cannot resolve the dispute within 30 days of one party notifying the other of the issue in writing, then the dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by binding arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted in English, in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (and any amendments). The seat and venue of arbitration shall be Hyderabad, India, unless we mutually agree on another location. The arbitration shall be conducted by a sole arbitrator jointly appointed by the parties (or if we cannot agree, appointed in accordance with the rules of an established arbitration center, e.g., the Indian Council of Arbitration). The arbitrator&apos;s award shall be final and binding on both parties, and it may be entered as a judgment in any competent court.</p>

  <h4>Class Action Waiver</h4>
  <p>You and Fit-C agree that any dispute resolution will be conducted on an individual basis only, and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. This means, to the extent permissible by law, you waive any right to litigate or arbitrate any dispute as a class action or in a representative capacity on behalf of others.</p>

  <h4>Injunctive Relief</h4>
  <p>Notwithstanding the above arbitration clause, both parties retain the right to seek interim or preliminary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any actual or threatened misuse or misappropriation of their intellectual property or confidential information. For example, if you were to misuse our IP in violation of these Terms, we could go to court for an order to stop you immediately, without waiting for an arbitration decision, and vice versa.</p>

  <h4>Jurisdiction</h4>
  <p>Subject to the arbitration agreement above, for any permitted court proceedings (e.g., enforcement of arbitration award or interim relief), the courts at Hyderabad, Telangana shall have exclusive jurisdiction, and both you and Fit-C waive any objection to that venue (subject-matter jurisdiction being as per Indian law).</p>

  <h4>Legal Fees</h4>
  <p>In any litigation or arbitration arising out of or related to these Terms, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs from the other party, in addition to any relief awarded. This clause may be subject to the arbitrator&apos;s discretion in arbitration cases.</p>

  <h2>15. App Store Terms; Third-Party Beneficiaries</h2>
  <p><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> These Terms are between you and Fit-C only, and not with any third-party app store provider (e.g., Apple or Google). Fit-C, not Apple/Google, is solely responsible for the content, maintenance, and support of the Trainer App. You acknowledge that Apple and Google have no obligation to furnish any maintenance or support services for the app.</p>

  <p><strong>App Store Compliance:</strong> You agree to comply with all applicable terms of service or usage rules of the platform from which you downloaded the app, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store terms. Your license to use the app is limited to a non-transferable license to use it on any device that you own or control and as permitted by those store terms (for example, Apple&apos;s terms would restrict usage to iOS devices you own/control, and as per the “Usage Rules” in the App Store Terms of Service).</p>

  <p><strong>Third-Party Beneficiaries:</strong> You acknowledge and agree that the app store provider and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms. Upon your acceptance of these Terms, the app store provider (e.g., Apple, and for Android, Google) will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary. This clause simply means that, for example, Apple can rely on these Terms (specifically the App Store-related terms) in case of any issue and has the right to ensure we and you adhere to them.</p>

  <p><strong>Warranty by Developer:</strong> In case of any failure of the Trainer App to conform to any applicable warranty (express or implied), you may notify the app store provider, and they may refund the purchase price (if any) for the app to you. Beyond that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the app store will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever for the app, and no other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be their responsibility. (Note: As we have disclaimed warranties and the app is generally free, this is largely a formality required by Apple&apos;s terms.)</p>

  <p><strong>Product Claims:</strong> You acknowledge that Apple/Google are not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Trainer App or your possession and/or use of the app, including but not limited to: (i) product-liability claims; (ii) any claim that the app fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Any such claims are governed by these Terms and the laws applicable, with Fit-C being responsible for addressing them (to the extent required by law).</p>

  <p><strong>Intellectual Property Claims:</strong> If a third party claims that the Trainer App or your use of it infringes someone&apos;s intellectual property rights, Fit-C (not Apple or Google) will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such IP infringement claim. We take IP matters seriously and will handle any such claim in accordance with law and our indemnity to you (if applicable, under Section 10) or to the claimant.</p>

  <p><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.N. or Indian Government embargo, or that has been designated by the Indian Government or U.S. Government as a “terrorist-supporting” country, and (ii) you are not listed on any Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. (This clause is required by Apple for apps distributed through its store.)</p>

  <p><strong>Developer Contact:</strong> If you have any questions, complaints, or claims with respect to the Trainer App, you can contact Fit-C at: support@fit-c.com or call +91-XXX-XXXXXXX. You can also reach us at our office: BJ Dhanvi Software Solutions Private Limited with brand name.,________________________________________________.

Any additional or different terms you propose (for example, in conversation or by other document) are rejected unless expressly agreed in writing by an authorized representative of Fit-C.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Amendments</h4>
      <p>Any amendment or modification to these Terms will be made by Fit-C as described in the Introduction (with notice to you in case of significant changes). If we need to clarify a minor point or correct a mistake, we may do so by posting an update and without individual notice if it doesn’t materially affect your rights. If you continue using the app after a change, you are deemed to accept the updated Terms. If you do not agree to changes, you must stop using the platform and may request account deletion.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>No Waiver</h4>
      <p>If either party fails to enforce a provision of these Terms or delays in doing so, it will not be considered a waiver of their rights. Any waiver of rights or remedies under these Terms must be in writing and signed by the party waiving to be effective.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>Severability</h4>
      <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Both parties agree to negotiate in good faith a valid and enforceable provision that is as similar as possible to the provision that was held unenforceable, to replace it.</p>
