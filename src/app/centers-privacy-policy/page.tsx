          <p>Fit-C Centre Dashboard – Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Last Updated: 2025-10-15</p>
<p>1. Introduction	
This Privacy Policy describes how BJ Dhanvi Software Solutions Private Limited with brand name Fit-C (“we” or “us”) collects, uses, shares, and protects personal data in relation to the Fit-C Centre Dashboard and associated services (collectively, the “Centre Platform”). The Centre Platform is provided to fitness centres, gyms, studios, or similar organizations (referred to here as “Centres” or “you”) to manage memberships, payments, scheduling, staff (including trainers), promotions, CRM, events, and other operations. We understand that the Centre Platform involves handling a significant amount of personal data – including data about your members (end users) and trainers – and we are committed to helping you manage that data responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws. This Policy explains our respective roles and responsibilities regarding personal data, what data we collect and process, how we use it, and how it is shared. It also outlines the privacy choices and rights available to you and to individuals whose data is processed via the Centre Platform.</p>
<p>By using the Centre Dashboard or related services, you confirm that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy. If you, as a Centre or authorized Centre admin, do not agree with any part of this Policy, please refrain from using the platform.</p>
<p>Role of Fit-C vs Centre: It is important to note that Centres have primary control over and responsibility for the personal data of their members and trainers that are managed via the Fit-C platform. In data protection terms, the Centre typically acts as the “data fiduciary” (or data controller) for member and trainer data – determining the purposes and means of processing – while Fit-C acts as a “data processor” (or service provider) that processes such data on the Centre&apos;s behalf. This means that while this Policy outlines how Fit-C handles data within the platform, Centres must ensure they have appropriate legal grounds (such as consent) to collect and use personal data in the platform, and that they comply with their obligations under privacy laws. We assist by providing tools and safeguards, but we rely on Centres to use the platform in a law-abiding manner.</p>
<p>2. Data We Collect via the Centre Platform	
When a Centre uses the Fit-C Centre Dashboard, data is collected at multiple levels: Centre account data, data about Centre staff (including trainers), and data about end users (members/clients). Below are the categories of data involved:</p>
<p>Centre Account Information: To set up your Centre on our platform, we collect business-related data such as the Centre&apos;s name, address, contact details (phone, email), and administrative contact persons. We may also collect billing details (e.g., GST number, billing address) and payment information for subscription fees (such as UPI details, bank account, or credit card info, processed via secure payment gateways). If the Centre has multiple branches, we may collect information for each branch (location, manager contact, etc.).</p>
<p>Administrator and Staff Data: For individuals who are given access to the Centre Dashboard (Centre administrators, receptionists, managers, etc.), we collect personal data to create their user accounts. This typically includes name, work email, phone number, job title/role, and authentication credentials for the platform (like username and password or SSO identity). If staff use the platform&apos;s attendance or HR features, we might also process work schedules, performance metrics, or other work-related info. For trainers onboarded by a Centre: their profile information (name, qualifications, contact), schedule, payroll/payout data (if managed through our system) and similar details are collected. Much of trainer data overlaps with what&apos;s described in the Trainer App Privacy Policy, but within the Centre context, the Centre can input or edit trainer info too.</p>
<p>Member (End User) Personal Data: This is a significant category. When your members join and use services through the Fit-C platform (often via the Fit-C User App or through Centre staff input), the system collects and stores their personal data. This can include:</p>
<p>Identification and Contact Details: Name, phone number, email, date of birth, gender, address of the member.</p>
<p>Membership and Transaction Data: Membership start/end dates, membership plan details, payment history (fees paid, invoices), attendance logs (gym check-ins), class or session bookings, cancellations, and renewals. If your Centre offers trials or guest passes via the platform, visitor info might also be recorded.</p>
<p>Fitness and Health Data: The platform can record fitness assessment details and progress metrics – e.g., height, weight, BMI, body fat percentage, workout history, diet preferences, injury or medical conditions (if the member provides that to tailor their program), and any biometric data captured (like heart rate, if integrated via wearable sync). Biometric and health data are considered sensitive, and we treat them with higher security (see Section 5 on Data Security).</p>
<p>Activity Data: Data on classes or training sessions the member has participated in, trainer feedback notes, challenge or event participation (if using the Events Marketplace), usage of AI Chatbot (e.g., if the member interacts with a fitness chatbot, the questions they ask might be logged), and engagement with promotions or referrals.</p>
<p>Communication Data: If the platform includes messaging or community features, any interactions the member has (posts, chats with trainers, feedback submitted) are stored. Additionally, if members contact Fit-C support, those communications are logged.</p>
<p>Device/Technical Data: When members use the mobile app or interact via web, we may collect device identifiers, operating system, IP address, and cookies or similar tracking technologies (for functionality like keeping the member logged in, or for analytics on usage patterns).</p>
<p>Centre Operations Data: The platform may generate or house other data related to centre operations: for example, inventory of products if you use a POS module (like listing merchandise and sales records), CRM notes about leads and prospects, marketing campaign details (e.g., email/SMS blasts and who opened them), and event listings. While not personal data per se, these often intersect with personal data (e.g., a lead&apos;s contact info, or which members bought a product). We handle these as part of your business data.</p>
<p>Feedback and Surveys: If either the Centre or Fit-C conducts surveys (like member satisfaction surveys, trainer performance reviews) through the platform, and respondents provide answers, those responses are collected and tied to the individual respondents if not anonymous.</p>
<p>3. How We Use the Data	
Fit-C uses the data collected through the Centre Platform for the following purposes, acting primarily as a service provider to the Centre:</p>
<p>Service Delivery: First and foremost, we process data to deliver the functionality of the Centre Dashboard and connected Fit-C services. This means using member and trainer data to populate your dashboards, manage schedules, send reminders, process payments, and otherwise fulfill the core operations you or your staff initiate on the platform. For example, if you schedule a class for a group, the system will use member contact info to send notifications; if you update a trainer&apos;s profile, it will reflect to users in the app; if a member makes a payment, their transaction is recorded and a digital receipt may be emailed. All these actions involve data processing that we carry out on your behalf.</p>
<p>Centre Administration: We use Centre account and admin data to manage the relationship with your Centre. This includes billing you for subscription fees, notifying you of platform changes or downtime, sending administrative emails (e.g., renewal notices, feature updates), and responding to any Centre support requests. We may also use Centre contact information to offer new features or modules to you (our customer) that could enhance your business, but you can opt-out of promotional communications if you prefer.</p>
<p>Analytics and Reporting for Centre: The platform aggregates data into useful analytics for your Centre&apos;s benefit – for instance, revenue reports, membership growth trends, class attendance statistics, trainer performance analytics, and CRM funnel metrics. We generate and display these reports to authorized Centre users to help you make data-driven decisions. Such analysis might involve computing averages, totals, and other derived insights from raw data. We also might send you periodic summary reports (e.g., a weekly email of key metrics).</p>
<p>Improvement of Platform (Product Development): Fit-C is continuously improving its technology. We use data (often in aggregated or anonymized form) to understand usage patterns and performance issues. For example, we may analyze how often certain features are used by Centres or which parts of the interface cause confusion, based on clickstream or support queries. We might look at aggregated member engagement data across all centres to guide new feature development (e.g., if we see many centres scheduling a certain type of class, we might develop templates for it). We also train our AI features (like the AI Chatbot and recommendation engine) on a pool of data that may include interactions and outcomes, but when doing so, we either use anonymized data or ensure that the AI&apos;s outputs do not expose personal details of any individual. Using aggregated/anonymized data for our product improvement is a key part of our service, and by using our platform, you grant us the ability to use your Centre&apos;s data for these analytical purposes. However, we do not use any personal data in a way that would identify your Centre&apos;s members or share your Centre-specific data with other centres – analytics that leave our system would be high-level and generalized.</p>
<p>Support and Training: If you reach out for support, we will access relevant data to assist you (for example, if a member&apos;s record is not showing correctly, we might look at that member&apos;s profile and activity logs to diagnose). We also use data from support incidents to improve our responses and to create help resources. For instance, if multiple centres ask how to do a certain task, we may create a knowledge base article using a generic scenario. Support calls or chats may be recorded or logged for quality and training purposes, and we’ll treat any personal info in them according to this policy.</p>
<p>Compliance and Legal Obligations: We may process and retain data as necessary to comply with legal obligations or regulatory requirements. For example, under India&apos;s data protection law we might need to ensure consent records are kept, or respond to data access/deletion requests from individuals (which we would coordinate with you as needed). We also keep data backups and logs as part of standard IT practices, which might contain personal data, to comply with cybersecurity best practices and legal requirements (such as those under IT Act rules). If law enforcement or other authorities lawfully request information, we may process data to comply, as outlined in Section 6.</p>
<p>Protecting Rights and Preventing Misuse: We may use data (and share it with appropriate authorities) if we believe it&apos;s necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, or violations of our terms and agreements. For example, if we detect unusual login patterns that suggest an account is compromised, we might analyze logs to confirm and then warn you or suspend access to protect data. Similarly, if a member or trainer reports misuse of data or harassment through the platform, we will review relevant data to address the issue.</p>
<p>Where we act as a data processor (processing member and trainer data on your behalf), we will not use that data for any purpose outside the scope of providing services to you and improving the platform as described. We will not use your members’ personal data to market to them or sell their information. Fit-C might contact members only as needed to deliver services (e.g., sending a verification OTP, or an app update notification) or if we are asked by you to do so on your behalf (e.g., sending a message to all members about a new facility via the platform&apos;s campaign tool).</p>
<p>4. Disclosure of Data (Sharing)	
Fit-C will share or disclose data in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>Within the Platform Ecosystem (Centre, Trainer, User Apps): The Fit-C platform is designed to allow controlled sharing of information between different interfaces: Centre Dashboard, Trainer App, and User App. For instance, when a Centre updates a class schedule on the Centre Dashboard, that schedule (with trainer name and class time) is visible to members in the User App. When a trainer enters a note about a member&apos;s progress on the Trainer App, the Centre Dashboard (and possibly the User App, if intended for the member to see) will reflect that note. Thus, data flows by design to the relevant parties: member personal data is visible to the Centre and their assigned trainers; trainer profile data is visible to the Centre and to members who interact with that trainer; Centre announcements or events are visible to all members of that Centre, etc. These are intra-platform disclosures that you control by how you use the software. We ensure that only the appropriate linked accounts can see each other&apos;s data (e.g., one Centre cannot see another Centre&apos;s member list unless an individual is actually a member of both).</p>
<p>Service Providers (Processors): Fit-C uses third-party service providers to support our infrastructure and operations. Examples include cloud hosting providers (for data storage and servers), email/SMS delivery services (to send out OTPs, notifications or campaigns), payment processors (to handle transactions like membership payments or subscription billing), and analytics services or crash reporting tools. We share only necessary data with these providers: for instance, a payment gateway will receive the transaction details and card info when processing a payment; an SMS API will get the phone number and message content to deliver an OTP. All such providers are bound by contracts to process data only under our instructions and to implement suitable security measures. We conduct due diligence to ensure they comply with applicable privacy standards. Some key providers might include companies like AWS or Azure (cloud hosting), Razorpay or Paytm (payments in India), Twilio or Msg91 (communications) – these are illustrative and subject to change. A current list of major sub-processors can be provided on request for transparency.</p>
<p>With Your Consent or Instruction: We might share data with third parties if you (the Centre) explicitly instruct us to or consent to it. For example, if you integrate Fit-C with another software via our API or an integration (say, integrating with a local accounting system or marketing tool), we will transfer data to that third-party as needed for the integration, since you’ve effectively authorized it. Another example is if a Centre asks us to help coordinate with a third-party consultant or IT support that you hired – with proper permissions, we might work with them and share relevant data. Any such sharing will be as per your request and direction.</p>
<p>Business Transfers: If Fit-C undergoes a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, personal data in our possession might be among the assets transferred to the new entity. In such an event, we will ensure that the successor entity is bound to the same standards of privacy as outlined in this Policy. We will also provide notice (e.g., via email or a prominent platform notice) if a transfer affects your data, giving you the opportunity to discontinue using the service if you wish before the data becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p>Legal Compliance: We may disclose data to third parties (including governmental authorities) if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (b) enforce our agreements, including investigation of potential violations; or (c) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Fit-C, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law. For example, if we receive a court order to provide certain Centre records (perhaps in context of a legal dispute or investigation), we will comply to the extent the law compels us, and we’ll typically attempt to notify the Centre (unless legally barred). Similarly, if there&apos;s a breach of data security, we may need to notify regulators and affected individuals, coordinating with you (the Centre) under data protection laws.</p>
<p>Aggregated Insights: We might share aggregated, anonymized insights externally – for instance, publishing a report that “average monthly attendance in fitness centres increased by X% in 2025” or partnering with a research institution on fitness trends. Such insights will not reveal any personal or Centre-identifiable data. Aggregated data may draw from across our platform and is stripped of personal identifiers. This type of sharing is more about industry knowledge and does not compromise individual privacy.</p>
<p>Importantly, Fit-C does not share your end-users’ personal data with advertisers or marketers for their own use. We also do not sell personal data. Any promotions or communications sent to your members via our system are either triggered by you or are transactional (like reminders, OTPs). Fit-C might send platform-wide announcements to users (for instance, new terms updates, or security alerts), but we do not inject unrelated third-party ads targeting your members.</p>
<p>5. Data Stewardship and Responsibilities	
Because Centres have full access and control over user and trainer data on the platform, it&apos;s crucial to delineate responsibilities for protecting that data:</p>
<p>Centre&apos;s Responsibilities: As a Centre, you are responsible for the personal data of your members and trainers that you collect and input into the system. This means:</p>
<p>You should have a clear legal basis for processing such data. In practice, this often means obtaining the member&apos;s consent at sign-up for collecting their personal and health data, or having a contractual necessity (membership contract) or legitimate interest. Under the DPDP Act, consent must be free, informed, specific, and clear, and a notice must be given to the individual explaining what data is collected and why. We strongly advise Centres to provide their members and staff with a privacy notice or policy that covers the use of Fit-C platform as part of your operations. (Fit-C can assist by providing a template or by offering in-app user consent flows, but the obligation lies with you as the data fiduciary for your members’ data.)</p>
<p>You must ensure data quality – i.e., that the personal data you or your staff enter is accurate and up-to-date. If a member corrects their information, promptly update it in the system. Fit-C provides interfaces for editing profiles and records; you should use these to honor any corrections or deletions requested by your members.</p>
<p>You are also responsible for handling any privacy rights requests from your members or trainers. If a member asks, “Please delete my data” or “Give me a copy of my data,” it is primarily your duty to verify the request and decide on it, since you have the direct relationship with them. Fit-C will assist you in fulfilling such requests (for example, we can help export data or remove data from our systems when you instruct us to). But we will not independently erase or provide someone&apos;s data without your instruction, except as required by law or as needed for service maintenance.</p>
<p>You should maintain the confidentiality of login credentials and ensure that only authorized personnel in your organization access the Centre Dashboard and related tools. If you have multiple staff accounts, use our role-based access controls to limit who can see what (e.g., maybe only senior admins can export full member lists). Immediately revoke access for staff who leave your organization or should no longer see member personal data. Fit-C logs admin activities (like data exports or deletions) and can provide audit trails if needed.</p>
<p>Under the law, as a data fiduciary you also must address grievances of data principals (members) and can be held accountable for data breaches or misuse. This means implementing necessary organizational measures: educating your staff on privacy, not using the platform to perform unauthorized actions (like looking up a celebrity&apos;s data out of curiosity), and reporting any incidents to Fit-C promptly.</p>
<p>White-Label Branding Implications: If you use Fit-C in a white-label manner (your branding on the user app, custom domain, etc.), users may not realize Fit-C is powering the service. In such cases, it is especially important that your privacy communications to users are clear – they might view the service as entirely run by your Centre. Make sure your privacy policy (or terms) provided to users covers the data collection through the app and mentions that you utilize Fit-C as a service provider. Fit-C remains committed to confidentiality in a white-label scenario; we will act behind the scenes and, unless required, we do not overtly present ourselves to your end-users. However, per app store rules or legal requirements, some disclosures might still mention Fit-C (for example, the app&apos;s “About” might say “Powered by Fit-C”).</p>
<p>Fit-C&apos;s Responsibilities: As the platform provider and data processor for Centre-controlled data, Fit-C is responsible for processing that data securely and only as instructed, which includes:</p>
<p>Implementing appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access, loss, or breach. (More on security in Section 7.) We also ensure that our employees who handle Centre data are trained in confidentiality and data protection.</p>
<p>Not accessing or using the data for purposes outside the scope of delivering and improving the service (unless required by law). We do not mine your member data to sell or to contact them for unrelated services. If we ever propose a new use of data beyond the original scope, we will seek your permission (and you in turn might need to seek your members’ permission).</p>
<p>Assisting Centres in complying with law: for example, giving you tools to fulfill deletion or correction requests, enabling consent capture features, and notifying you promptly of any data breaches so you can take appropriate action (we are aware the DPDP Act mandates breach notification within tight timelines, so we have internal processes to detect and alert on such events).</p>
<p>Adhering to any specific data processing terms we may have with you (such as a Data Processing Agreement if executed separately, which would be aligned with these principles). Fit-C will also cooperate with any audits or inspections that might be legitimately required (for instance, if you are a “significant data fiduciary” under law and need to audit processors).</p>
<p>Serving as a point of contact for privacy concerns. We have a Grievance Officer (contact in Section 9) who handles any escalations related to personal data on our platform. If a data principal reaches out to us directly, we typically refer them to the Centre if it&apos;s about Centre-controlled data (since you have the relationship). But if needed, we will work together to resolve any complaint.</p>
<p>In summary, Fit-C and the Centre are partners in data stewardship. We provide the secure tools and follow your lead; you operate those tools ethically and lawfully. Should any confusion arise over who should do what in terms of privacy, we are happy to clarify and assist, as ultimately we share the goal of keeping user trust.</p>
<p>6. International Data Transfers	
Fit-C is an India-based service, and we primarily store and process data on servers located in India. However, some of our service providers or backup systems might be located in other countries. For example, if we use a global cloud provider, your data might be stored in a data center in Asia-Pacific region outside India or even in the US or EU, depending on service architecture and backup rotations. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 allows transfer of personal data outside India except to certain restricted countries (to be notified by the government). We carefully monitor any rules or notifications about cross-border data transfers. At the time of this Policy, we ensure that data is only sent to jurisdictions that are not disallowed, and if required, we will implement contractual safeguards (like standard clauses or comparable protections) to ensure that your data receives an adequate level of protection even outside India.</p>
<p>If you as a Centre are particularly concerned about data location (for instance, some Centres might prefer all data to remain in India due to client expectations or internal policy), please discuss this with us. We can architect solutions such as India-only data hosting if needed or ensure certain sensitive categories (like biometric data) are stored only on Indian servers if that is a compliance need. Our default practice is to use Indian servers for primary data and restrict routine access from overseas. When we use foreign sub-processors (like an email service that routes through global servers), we rely on legal mechanisms for transfer and ensure they are bound to confidentiality and security commitments.</p>
<p>We also want to highlight that when data is in our system, even if it resides temporarily on servers abroad, Fit-C maintains control and strict access. No foreign entity gets to access the raw data unless they are our contracted provider acting under our instructions, as described.</p>
<p>For members’ perspective: If a member asks, “Is my data stored internationally?” — the answer is: primarily in India, but potentially mirrored or backed up in other countries which have equal or stronger data protection standards, and always under Fit-C&apos;s control. We do not offload data to any third parties except those needed for service functionality as covered.</p>
<p>7. Data Security	
We employ robust security measures to safeguard personal data on the Fit-C platform. Our approach includes technical, administrative, and physical security controls:</p>
<p>Encryption: All network communications between the Centre Dashboard (or other Fit-C apps) and our servers are encrypted via HTTPS/TLS. This means that when you or your members enter information, it&apos;s transmitted securely. Sensitive personal data and financial information are additionally encrypted at rest in our databases or in secure vaults (for example, passwords are hashed, payment instrument details are tokenized or stored by a PCI-compliant payment gateway rather than on our own servers).</p>
<p>Access Controls: We operate on the principle of least privilege. Within Fit-C, only authorized employees who require access to Centre data to support you (such as tech support or engineers investigating an issue) are granted access, and even then it&apos;s limited and monitored. Our staff undergo background checks and are trained in data handling practices. Access to production systems is secured with multi-factor authentication and network restrictions. On your side, we offer features like role-based permissions so you can limit what each Centre staff user can see or do. Always keep your account credentials secure and use strong passwords. We may also implement additional security features like IP whitelisting (if requested) or device management for admin accounts.</p>
<p>Monitoring and Auditing: Our systems log access and actions (e.g., logins, data changes, exports). We actively monitor for unusual patterns, such as rapid large data exports or repeated failed logins, which could indicate a security threat. We utilize intrusion detection systems and have automated alerts for certain events. Regular audits of permissions and software libraries are conducted. We also comply with any cybersecurity guidelines applicable (e.g., CERT-In guidelines in India). Penetration tests and vulnerability assessments are done periodically by in-house teams or external experts.</p>
<p>Secure Development and Testing: Fit-C follows secure software development life cycle (SDLC) practices. New features undergo code reviews focusing on security. We sanitize and protect data inputs and outputs to prevent common vulnerabilities (like SQL injection, XSS). Test environments do not use real personal data or, if needed, the data is thoroughly anonymized.</p>
<p>Data Backups and Recovery: We maintain encrypted backups of data to prevent loss from accidental deletion or catastrophic events. Backups are stored securely (with encryption) and tested for restorability. In case of any data loss incident, we have a disaster recovery plan to restore data with minimal downtime. Our hosting providers are required to have strong physical security and redundancy.</p>
<p>Third-Party Security: As mentioned, we impose security requirements on our vendors. When we evaluate third-party solutions, we consider their certifications and standards. We ensure that if data is processed by a third party (like sending an email), that data is transmitted and stored securely by them as well.</p>
<p>Incident Response: We have an incident response plan in place. If despite all precautions we experience a security breach affecting personal data, we will promptly contain and investigate the incident. Affected Centres will be notified without undue delay as per legal requirements, and we’ll coordinate on any notifications to individuals or authorities. We log incidents and take post-mortem actions to prevent recurrence. Also, we provide channels (like support@fit-c.com) for anyone to report vulnerabilities or suspicious activities related to the platform. We encourage responsible disclosure and prioritize such reports.</p>
<p>Physical and Organizational Measures: Our offices (where applicable) have security controls to prevent unauthorized access to systems (e.g., badge entry, visitor logs). We minimize physical document storage – nearly all data is digital. Employees adhere to clear desk policies. Organizationally, we limit which teams can access what data. For instance, customer support might see member profiles to help troubleshoot, but they won’t have access to backend databases wholesale. Engineering may have broad access in development but not production unless necessary. These internal controls are regularly reviewed.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while we strive to use industry-leading security measures, no system can be 100% secure. The strength of security also depends on safe practices by Centres and users (like using strong passwords, updating apps, etc.). We ask that you also take steps such as keeping your devices secure, updating your Centre admin passwords periodically, and informing us if you suspect any account compromise. Together, we can maintain a secure environment for everyone&apos;s data.</p>
<p>8. Data Retention and Deletion	
We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, as outlined in this Policy, and to comply with legal obligations. How this works in context:</p>
<p>Active Use: For as long as your Centre remains a customer using the Fit-C platform, we will retain all the data associated with your account – members, trainers, schedules, etc. – so that the service runs smoothly. Active records (like current members, ongoing memberships, current year transactions) are accessible in the Dashboard.</p>
<p>Archival of Former Members: When a member leaves your Centre or their membership expires, their profile may become inactive but not immediately deleted, since you might need to access their history for some time (for example, if they rejoin or if there&apos;s a later inquiry or a refund). We typically allow Centres to archive members, meaning the data is marked inactive but kept for your reference. You can manually delete a member&apos;s profile if you have no further need for it (assuming no law requires retention). Otherwise, over time, we may auto-archive older lapsed members to declutter the active list.</p>
<p>Legal Requirements: There are laws that may require retention of certain data for a minimum period. For instance, financial and transaction records might be needed for tax or accounting for 10 years. Health-related records (if any medical context) might have recommended retention periods. Also, under DPDP Act, if consent is withdrawn or purpose fulfilled, data should be deleted unless required for legal purposes. Fit-C&apos;s approach is to allow Centres control: you can export and then delete data when you no longer need it, but if you don’t take action, we won’t purge it arbitrarily as long as you&apos;re a customer. However, we might periodically prompt you for data minimization best practices (like “it appears you have members inactive for 5+ years, consider deleting if not needed”).</p>
<p>Terminated Centre Accounts: If your Centre stops using Fit-C (for example, your subscription ends and you do not renew), we will retain your data for a limited period in a disabled form. Specifically, we might keep it for, say, 120 days post termination, during which you have the chance to export any data if you didn’t already. This also covers any grace period if there was a billing issue. After that window, we will commence the deletion of your Centre&apos;s personal data from our live systems. We may retain certain minimal information for longer for legitimate purposes – such as your Centre&apos;s contact info and contract details for financial records or any legal disputes, or logs of system use for security and auditing – but member and trainer personal data would be purged or anonymized. We’ll notify you at the point of termination about data retrieval and deletion procedures.</p>
<p>Backup Retention: Data deleted from live databases may persist in backup storage for some additional time. Our backups are cyclical – e.g., we might have weekly snapshots retained for a few weeks, monthly for a few months, etc., after which they are overwritten. During that retention, backups are stored securely and eventually deleted/destroyed in a secure manner. We do not restore backups for individual deletion requests, but if needed (like for a lawful deletion request by a data principal), we ensure that any restored backup would also have the deletion re-applied.</p>
<p>Anonymized Data: As noted, we may retain anonymized or aggregated data (which is no longer personal data) indefinitely, to benefit from cumulative insights. For example, even if a member&apos;s personal details are deleted, the fact that “one member of Centre X attended 50 sessions in 2023” might be counted in aggregated stats that feed overall product analysis. Such information will not identify individuals and possibly not even specific centres, and thus can be kept.</p>
<p>Request-Based Deletion: If a member or data subject associated with your Centre exercises their right to erasure (and you approve that request as appropriate), we will assist in deleting their data from the platform promptly. This would include removing their personal identifiers, and either wiping or anonymizing other records relating to them. (E.g., their name is removed, but perhaps a payment entry might stay with name cleared but amount kept for accounting). We log when we perform deletions for accountability.</p>
<p>Exceptions: We might retain data longer than normal if required to by law (e.g., a preservation order for an investigation) or in limited cases if the data is needed for a legal claim (for instance, if there&apos;s a litigation or dispute, we may need to keep relevant information until it&apos;s resolved). We ensure any such retained data is only used for that purpose and securely protected.</p>
<p>In summary, you have control over much of the retention through your actions on the dashboard, and Fit-C aligns with that. When data is no longer needed, we aim to either return it to you (via exports), delete it, or irreversibly anonymize it. We strive not to hold personal data indefinitely without justification.</p>
<p>9. Individual Rights and How to Exercise Them	
On the Centre Platform, there are two layers of individuals’ rights to consider: (A) the rights of your members and trainers (data subjects) whose data is managed by you on our platform, and (B) the rights of you as an individual Centre user or admin interacting with Fit-C. We address both:</p>
<p>A. Member/Trainer Data Subject Rights:	
Under Indian law (and analogous global privacy norms), individuals have rights such as:</p>
<p>Right to Access: Members or trainers can request confirmation of whether you (and by extension, Fit-C as your processor) have their personal data, and a copy or summary of that data. Through the Fit-C User App, members already can see much of their data (like their profile, attendance, etc.). If a formal request comes, the Centre can export the member&apos;s data from the dashboard (we can assist if needed) to provide a report.</p>
<p>Right to Correction: If personal data is inaccurate or outdated, individuals can ask to have it corrected. In practice, many profile details can be edited by members themselves via the app (like contact info) or by Centre staff (like updating a misspelled name or adjusting a record). Fit-C ensures that once updated on one interface, all linked records reflect the change (for example, trainer updates member&apos;s weight reading, it shows in Centre records and member app).</p>
<p>Right to Deletion: Individuals may request deletion of their personal data when it&apos;s no longer necessary or if they withdraw consent. As the Centre, you evaluate such requests. If a member is no longer in contract and asks to be forgotten, you might agree to delete their profile and related data. You can do so on the platform (with appropriate admin rights). If a trainer leaves and asks removal, similarly. Fit-C will carry out full deletion on our end as instructed. One nuance: some data (like financial transactions) might be needed to retain for legitimate reasons; in such cases, you’d explain that to the individual (e.g., “We cannot delete your invoice due to accounting laws, but we can delete your contact info and deactivate your account”). We can help pseudonymize certain data if that helps (for instance, replace a name with “Member123” but keep the transaction record).</p>
<p>Right to Data Portability: While not explicitly codified in DPDP Act like GDPR, it&apos;s a good practice – a member might want their data in a structured digital form to transfer to another service. We can help export an individual&apos;s data in CSV/JSON format if needed (e.g., their workout history, measurements, etc.).</p>
<p>Right to Withdraw Consent: If processing is based on consent (like using their before-after photos in a gallery, or opting into chatbot suggestions), they can withdraw it. The Centre should then honor that (stop the processing in question). Our system might have toggles to respect such changes (like if someone opts out of chatbot analysis, we can exclude them from AI data processing going forward, and remove any optionally collected data).</p>
<p>Right to Grievance Redressal: If individuals have privacy concerns, they can approach the Centre&apos;s grievance mechanism. As per DPDP Act, they should ideally first approach you (data fiduciary) and if unsatisfied can escalate to the Data Protection Board. Fit-C, as processor, will support you in investigating and resolving any grievances. If someone contacts us directly, as mentioned earlier, we will typically loop in the Centre unless it&apos;s something we can handle (like a general question about how the app uses their data).</p>
<p>To facilitate these rights, Fit-C provides the tools in the software and support via our team. If you get a request and need help, reach out to our Grievance Officer or support channel; we consider assisting with data subject requests part of our obligation to you.</p>
<p>B. Centre User Rights (vis-à-vis Fit-C):	
If you are a point of contact or an individual at the Centre, we also hold some of your personal data (like your name, business email, maybe phone, and any logs of your interactions). For these, Fit-C is the data fiduciary because it&apos;s our direct relationship data (e.g., our contact list of admins, our user logs). You, as an individual, have similar rights toward us: you can ask what data we have about you as a contact person, request corrections (e.g., your email changed), or deletion (if you leave the Centre, you might want your account removed). We will gladly oblige, keeping in mind we might need to retain certain records (like communications you made on behalf of the Centre for audit trail). If we send marketing emails to you as a client, you can opt out anytime. If you as a Centre admin create a profile on our site (like a forum or blog comment), you can manage that or ask us to remove it.</p>
<p>Exercising Rights:</p>
<p>For Members/Trainers: They should ideally contact the Centre (you) to exercise rights. We recommend you designate a contact (e.g., your own Grievance Officer or support email) for them. If any such request comes to Fit-C directly, we will inform you and not act on it without your direction (unless it&apos;s something minimal like unsubscribing from an email list which we can handle directly).</p>
<p>For Centre Users: You can contact us at our Grievance Officer contact below, or via our support, to exercise your personal data rights related to our direct dealings. We will authenticate the request and address it promptly (within the timelines of law – DPDP requires acknowledgment in 24 hours and resolution within a reasonable time).</p>
<p>We aim to be transparent and cooperative in all cases. Note that if a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive (e.g., repetitive requests), we may charge a reasonable fee or refuse, as permitted by law, but we would explain why.</p>
<p>Also, be aware that rights are not absolute – e.g., if keeping data is required by law, we’ll inform the requester about the necessity. But our default is to honor legitimate requests.</p>
<p>10. Grievance Redressal and Contact Information	
Fit-C has appointed a Grievance Officer in accordance with the Information Technology Act rules and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act. This officer is responsible for addressing any privacy-related concerns or complaints from users, centres, or any data principals in a timely manner.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about how data is handled in the Fit-C Centre Dashboard, or wish to exercise any rights, you can reach out to us as follows:</p>
<p>Grievance Officer:</p>
<p>Email:</p>
<p>Address:</p>
<p>Phone:</p>
<p>Please include in your communication: your Centre name, your contact details, and a detailed description of your concern or request. If you are a member or trainer contacting directly, please mention which Centre you are associated with (so we can coordinate with them if needed).</p>
<p>We will acknowledge receipt of grievances or requests typically within 24 hours and aim to resolve or respond substantively within 15 days or as required by law. If a matter is complex and requires more time, we will keep you informed of the progress and reason for delay.</p>
<p>Escalation: If you are not satisfied with the resolution provided by us, and you are a data principal (e.g., a member) under DPDP Act, you may have the right to file a complaint with the Data Protection Board of India once it&apos;s established. We encourage trying to resolve with us first, as we are committed to finding a fair solution.</p>
<p>For general support or questions unrelated to privacy, you may contact our regular support channels (support@fit-c.com), but anything specifically about personal data protection should be directed to the Grievance Officer for proper handling.</p>
<p>11. App Store and Third-Party Platform	s
The Centre Dashboard is accessible via web and possibly via mobile applications on app stores (like an iPad or Android tablet app for Centre admins). If you obtain our app through an app store, note that while using the app, the data it collects is as described above. The app itself may request certain device permissions (for example, permission to send notifications, or access storage for downloading reports). These are optional and used only to enhance your experience (e.g., to allow file exports or to alert you of schedule changes). You can manage permissions through your device settings.</p>
<p>Any downloads from third-party app stores are subject to their privacy and data handling as well – for instance, app stores may collect info like what apps you download or reviews you leave. Those activities are governed by the app store&apos;s own privacy policy, not Fit-C&apos;s. Fit-C does not receive any personal data from app stores about you except maybe aggregate info (like number of downloads).</p>
<p>If the Centre Dashboard integrates with any social media or third-party login (for example, if we allow a Centre admin to log in with a Google account), then basic profile data from that login (such as name and email from Google) would be used to set up your account. That is done with your consent at the time of linking accounts. We will clearly indicate what info is fetched and you can choose not to use social login if you prefer.</p>
<p>12. Updates to this Privacy Policy	
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, and other factors. When we make an update, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of the Policy. If changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice – for example, a banner or notification through the Centre Dashboard, or an email to the account owner on file.</p>
<p>Significant changes might include any changes in the types of data collected, significant changes in processing purposes, or shifting of roles (for example, if Fit-C were to change how data controller/processor roles are structured). Minor changes, such as clarifications or typographical corrections, may be done simply by updating the Policy text here.</p>
<p>We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to stay informed of how we are protecting and managing the data. Continuing to use the Centre Platform after a new version of the Policy has been made available will indicate your acceptance of the updated terms (to the extent permitted by law). If you do not agree with any updated policy, you should stop using the platform and can request deletion of your data as per Section 8.</p>
<p>Fit-C Centre Dashboard – Terms & Conditions</p>
<p>1. Introduction	
These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) govern the use of Fit-C Centre Dashboard and associated services (“Centre Platform”) provided by BJ Dhanvi Software Solutions Private Limited (“Fit-C,” “we,” or “us”) to you, a fitness centre/gym/studio or similar entity (“Centre” or “you”). By signing up for and using the Centre Platform, you agree to these Terms, as well as our Privacy Policy and any other policies referenced herein. These Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between Fit-C and the Centre. If you are accepting on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms. Please read these Terms carefully before using the service. If you do not agree to them, you must not use the Centre Platform.</p>
<p>Fit-C reserves the right to update or modify these Terms from time to time. We will provide notice of material changes (for example, via email or a prominent dashboard notification) and the updated Terms will be posted with a revised effective date. Your continued use of the Centre Platform after such updates indicates acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree with changes, you may terminate the service as described in Section 12.</p>
<p>2. The Centre Platform and License Grant	
Fit-C&apos;s Centre Platform is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution that includes web and mobile interfaces for managing fitness business operations (such as member management, scheduling, payments, CRM, staff oversight, and events). Subject to your compliance with these Terms and payment of applicable fees, Fit-C grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and use the Centre Platform during the term of your subscription solely for your internal business purposes in operating your fitness centre.</p>
<p>Authorized Users: You may allow your employees or contractors (e.g., managers, receptionists, trainers affiliated with your centre) to access the Centre Platform as “Authorized Users” under your account, provided each such user is bound by confidentiality and use obligations at least as restrictive as those in these Terms. You are responsible for all actions of Authorized Users on the platform and for ensuring they abide by these Terms. If an Authorized User leaves your organization or should no longer have access, you must promptly revoke their credentials. Sharing of logins among multiple individuals is prohibited; each user should have a separate account login for accountability.</p>
<p>Scope of Use: You shall use the Centre Platform only for purposes related to managing your fitness business and serving your members and trainers. Any other use, including commercializing the platform to third parties or using it to process data for entities outside your organization without Fit-C&apos;s consent, is outside the scope of this license. You obtain no rights to the software or intellectual property itself; all such rights are retained by Fit-C and its licensors (see Section 8 on Intellectual Property). You agree not to attempt any reverse engineering, decompilation, or extraction of source code from the platform, nor to circumvent any usage limits or technical protections.</p>
<p>White-Label Branding: Fit-C may offer you the option for white-label or custom branding of the user-facing apps and interfaces. If provided, this means your trade name, logo, colors, and domain can be used within certain areas of the platform (e.g., the member app shows your logo, communications appear under your brand). This is a branding license we provide to you: Fit-C retains ownership of the underlying platform. You are granted the right to use our platform with your branding for as long as you have an active subscription. White-label does not imply ownership or a full transfer of the software to you – it is simply a cosmetic and experiential customization. Fit-C reserves the right to include a discreet “Powered by Fit-C” notice or similar attribution (especially if required by our policy or for transparency) unless otherwise agreed in writing. When using white-label features, you must ensure that end-users (your members) are aware that the services are powered by a technology provider (Fit-C), at least in your terms or privacy disclosures, to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>App Store Deployment: If white-labeling extends to publishing a mobile app under your name on app stores, Fit-C will either (a) publish and manage the app on your behalf via our developer account but under your brand (where possible), or (b) guide you to publish it under your own developer account with Fit-C providing the app build. In either case, you agree to abide by app store rules and coordinate with Fit-C. Fit-C may need you to furnish certain information or consents for app listings (e.g., rights to use your logo). The terms related to App Store/Play Store compliance, as outlined in Section 14 of the Trainer Terms (incorporated here by reference), apply equally, with necessary changes in roles (for example, your Centre&apos;s name may appear as the app publisher, but Fit-C remains the app developer responsible for maintenance, and Apple/Google will be third-party beneficiaries to certain obligations). You must not misrepresent the nature of the app or violate any app store terms. If an app store rejects or removes the app due to issues caused by your provided content (like your graphics or descriptions violating guidelines), that will be your responsibility to rectify. If due to the platform&apos;s code, Fit-C will address it.</p>
<p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted. Fit-C may monitor your usage (electronically) to ensure quality, improve services, and verify compliance with these Terms. Any such monitoring will be in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>3. Subscription Fees and Payment Terms	
Use of the Centre Platform is subject to the payment of subscription fees and other charges as agreed between you and Fit-C. The key financial terms are as follows:</p>
<p>Subscription Plan: Upon signing up, you will select a subscription plan (e.g., based on number of members, number of locations, or features/modules activated). The plan details, including the fee amount (in INR) and billing frequency (monthly, quarterly, annual, etc.), are either set forth in a separate Order Form or presented during online sign-up. These Terms incorporate that plan and any order details. For any usage beyond the base limits of your plan (for instance, if you exceed a member cap or add on a new module), additional fees may apply as per our pricing policies or as mutually agreed.</p>
<p>Revenue Sharing (Commission) Fees: In addition to fixed subscription fees, Fit-C and the Centre will share revenue on certain platform modules as follows:</p>
<p>AI Chatbot Module: If Fit-C&apos;s AI-powered fitness chatbot or engagement engine is provided as an add-on and monetized (for example, if members pay a premium for AI-driven personalized plans or if the Centre monetizes usage of the AI service), the Centre agrees to pay Fit-C a percentage of the revenue derived from that module. The exact percentage or fee (e.g., a commission of X% of net revenue from chatbot subscriptions or upsells) will be specified in your plan or addendum. If the AI module is used only for retention and not directly charged to members, then revenue share may not apply, but there might be an extra subscription fee for that feature instead – clarify with us in the plan.</p>
<p>Event Marketplace Module: The platform&apos;s Events Marketplace allows Centres (and trainers) to list paid events, classes, or workshops which can be booked by users (including possibly users from outside the Centre). For any revenue generated through events listed on the marketplace (such as ticket fees or enrollment fees for bootcamps, etc.), Fit-C will retain a portion as a service fee. Typically, Fit-C&apos;s commission may be a percentage of each transaction (for example, 10% of event fees collected), or a fixed fee per booking, as per what is communicated in the module&apos;s terms. The remainder is remitted to the Centre (or organizer). Fit-C will facilitate payment collection from end-users, deduct its share, and disburse the rest to you in accordance with payout cycles.</p>
<p>We will provide periodic statements (accessible via the dashboard or delivered) detailing the revenue collected and commission calculated. You acknowledge that Fit-C&apos;s role in these transactions is as an intermediary facilitating payments between you and the end-user, and that Fit-C&apos;s commission is compensation for providing the marketplace and payment service.</p>
<p>Payment Method: Subscription fees will be invoiced as per the billing cycle (e.g., charged upfront for the year or monthly). You agree to pay fees by the due date indicated. Payment methods accepted may include bank transfer, credit/debit card, UPI, or other electronic payment providers. We may offer auto-debit/recurring payment options for convenience, in which case you authorize us to charge your provided payment method each cycle. If you prefer manual payments, you must ensure timely remittance. Any revenue-share commissions due to Fit-C can be either deducted at source (as described for event payments) or invoiced separately (for example, if you collect chatbot revenue offline, we’d invoice our share).</p>
<p>Taxes: All fees are exclusive of any applicable taxes. You are responsible for any indirect taxes (like GST) or withholding taxes that may apply, as per Indian law. If GST is applicable, Fit-C will add it to invoices at the prevailing rate. You agree to provide necessary tax details (like GSTIN) to avail input credits if applicable. In case of withholding tax, you may deduct it as required by law from payments to Fit-C, but you shall furnish appropriate TDS certificates or documentation to Fit-C so we can claim credit. The parties will cooperate to minimize taxes legally (for example, by availing any exemptions or lower treaty rates if applicable).</p>
<p>Late Payments: If you fail to pay any amount due by the due date, Fit-C reserves the right to (a) charge a late fee or interest on the overdue sum. Interest may accrue at the rate of 1.5% per month (18% per annum) or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the due date until full payment; (b) suspend your access to the platform (after providing a notice and a cure period of, say, 15 days) until outstanding payments are made; and/or (c) terminate the subscription for material breach if amounts remain unpaid beyond a reasonable grace period. You will be responsible for any collection costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by Fit-C in recovering overdue amounts.</p>
<p>Fee Revisions: Fit-C may revise the subscription fees or commission rates for its services, typically at the time of renewal of your subscription term or when you opt to upgrade modules. We will give you reasonable advance notice (e.g., at least 30 days) of any fee changes. If you do not agree to the revised fees, you may elect not to renew or to terminate the affected service at the end of your current term (or as otherwise permitted). Continued use of the service into the renewal term constitutes acceptance of the new fees. For clarity, any change in revenue share percentages for the AI or Events modules would likewise be communicated and ideally applied prospectively (e.g., for new events created after the change date).</p>
<p>Refunds: Except as explicitly provided in an Order Form or required by law, fees are non-refundable. For instance, if you cancel in the middle of a billing period, the remaining period&apos;s fee is typically not refunded (we may consider proration in good faith if termination is due to our breach or a major service issue – see Termination section). If an end-user payment is refunded (in case of an event cancellation or other reason), Fit-C will adjust the commission accordingly (we do not profit from refunded transactions, but note that certain payment gateway fees might be non-refundable; those specifics will be transparent in statements).</p>
<p>We believe in fairness and transparency in our pricing. If you have questions or disputes about an invoice or calculation, you must notify us within 15 days of invoice receipt. Both parties agree to work in good faith to resolve billing disputes quickly. Undisputed portions of an invoice should be paid on time.</p>
<p>4. Centre Obligations and Acceptable Use	
As the Centre utilizing Fit-C&apos;s platform, you have certain obligations to ensure a smooth operation and compliance on the platform:</p>
<p>Lawful and Appropriate Use: You agree to use the Centre Platform only for lawful purposes and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. You will not use the platform in any way that infringes or misappropriates any third-party rights (including intellectual property, privacy, or publicity rights), or that is fraudulent, obscene, defamatory, threatening, or otherwise objectionable. You will ensure that the content you input or upload (e.g., your Centre&apos;s images, class descriptions, promotional materials) is accurate and does not contain harmful or unlawful material. You must not use the platform to store or disseminate any malicious code, spam, or unsolicited communications unrelated to your fitness business.</p>
<p>Member Data and Privacy: You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all necessary consents and rights from your members and staff to input their personal data into the platform and to allow Fit-C to process it for providing the service. This includes compliance with India&apos;s data protection laws as they evolve (see also the Privacy Policy and Section 5 on Data Protection). You should provide your members with a privacy notice that explains that you use Fit-C to manage their data. If a member requests access, correction, or deletion of their data, you should promptly address it (with Fit-C&apos;s assistance if needed). You must only use member personal data obtained through the platform for legitimate purposes related to your fitness services and not for any unrelated activities or sales to third parties. Also, if you use marketing features (like sending notifications or emails through the platform), ensure you honor members’ communication preferences and any opt-outs (for example, if someone unsubscribes from promotional emails, you won’t send them marketing via the platform).</p>
<p>Data Security – Centre&apos;s Role: While Fit-C secures the platform, you also have a role in maintaining security. This includes keeping your login credentials secure, using strong passwords, and limiting access to authorized personnel as noted. If you become aware of any breach or unauthorized access (like a staff login being compromised), you must immediately notify Fit-C and take steps to mitigate it (e.g., change passwords, remove users). You should also have basic cybersecurity measures on your end, such as updated antivirus on any computers accessing the dashboard and safe network practices when using the system. Do not attempt to gain access to areas of the platform you are not authorized to (like other clients’ data or server configurations) – doing so is a serious violation.</p>
<p>Content and Community Standards: If the platform provides community features (like member forums, social feeds, challenge leaderboards etc.), and your Centre participates or moderates such content, you should enforce basic community standards. Do not allow hate speech, harassment, or other violations via your Centre&apos;s postings. Fit-C may have its own community guidelines and reserves the right to remove or restrict content that violates laws or those guidelines. As a Centre admin, you have the ability and responsibility to manage content posted under your auspices (for example, if a trainer posts inappropriate content via the Centre&apos;s event page, you should remove it or ask us to assist).</p>
<p>White-Label/Branding Conditions: If you are using the platform in a white-label fashion (your brand front and center), you must ensure that this branding usage is in line with any branding guidelines provided by Fit-C. For example, we might ask that you display “Powered by Fit-C” in a certain way in your app&apos;s about page or that you do not remove certain legally required info. You also agree not to misrepresent the nature of the service: even under white-label, you cannot claim you built or own the platform&apos;s software. You can present it as “our fitness app powered by Fit-C&apos;s technology” or similar phrasing. Additionally, if your usage of the platform is white-labeled, any app store terms you agree to (if publishing an app) must be adhered to, and Fit-C should be appropriately credited as needed (per Section 14 of Trainer Terms that we incorporate for app distribution specifics).</p>
<p>Third-Party Integrations: You may not integrate or use the platform with any third-party software or service in a manner that violates the third-party&apos;s terms or these Terms. If you use Fit-C&apos;s API or export data to other tools, ensure those tools have proper security and that you don’t inadvertently expose data. If you choose to connect Fit-C with, say, a marketing tool, you are responsible for the data flow and compliance in that external tool. Fit-C isn’t liable for what happens outside our platform environment.</p>
<p>Prohibited Actions: You shall not: (i) license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, or exploit the platform or make it available to any third party (except authorized members and staff) as a service bureau or otherwise; (ii) use the platform to compete with Fit-C (for example, analyzing it to develop a similar platform, or using it to manage third-party businesses in a way that effectively makes you a SaaS provider using our backend without permission); (iii) use any automated means (like scraping, bots) to extract data from the service not meant for you; (iv) remove or obscure any proprietary notices, labels, or marks on the software (even if white-labeled, any underlying code comments or legal info should remain intact); (v) attempt to test or bypass security features, or perform penetration testing without written consent; (vi) upload any content that contains viruses or harmful code.</p>
<p>Compliance with App Store Terms: If your staff use the mobile Centre app through an app store, or if you distribute a custom-branded app, you must ensure compliance with the app store&apos;s terms (Apple App Store, Google Play, etc.). This includes not doing anything via the app that would cause a violation (for example, you can’t use the app to process payments in a way that violates in-app purchase rules if applicable – though as a B2B app likely that&apos;s fine). If an app store sets certain end-user terms (like Apple&apos;s required EULA terms or Google&apos;s policies), you will cooperate with Fit-C in implementing those, and you won’t encourage usage that conflicts with them.</p>
<p>We trust you to use the platform constructively. If Fit-C suspects, in good faith, that you are violating these obligations or any law (for instance, a serious misuse or illegal activity), we reserve the right to investigate, suspend access, or remove content, and work with authorities if necessary. We will, however, notify you of any such action (unless legally prohibited from doing so) and attempt to resolve the issue with minimal disruption.</p>
<p>5. Data Ownership and Data Protection	
This section clarifies ownership of data and key privacy/security responsibilities:</p>
<p>Your Data (Centre Data): As between Fit-C and the Centre, you retain all rights and ownership in the data you or your users input into the platform – such as member personal information, attendance records, trainer profiles, etc. Fit-C does not claim ownership of your proprietary data. We act as a custodian and processor of this data on your behalf. You grant Fit-C a license to host, process, and use this data as necessary to provide the services under these Terms, including as described in our Privacy Policy (e.g., using aggregated data to improve services). Fit-C will not use your identifiable Centre Data for any purpose outside the scope of delivering and enhancing the service, except with your consent or as required by law.</p>
<p>Fit-C Data & Analytics: Fit-C may generate certain data as a result of providing the service, such as usage logs, performance metrics, or aggregated analytics derived from multiple clients’ data. Fit-C also holds information like configuration settings, templates, or AI models improved through learning from usage (without personal identifiers). Fit-C retains ownership of these, as they constitute our intellectual property or know-how (provided that no personal data of your members is included in publicly shared analytics without permission). For example, if our AI learns general workout optimization from trends across centres, Fit-C owns that model, not any particular centre, but we do not include identifiable member info in that model.</p>
<p>Data Protection Compliance: Fit-C and the Centre shall comply with applicable data protection laws in performing their obligations. The Centre is considered the data fiduciary/controller for member and trainer personal data, and Fit-C is a data processor. Fit-C will process personal data only on your instructions (as set in these Terms and your use of the platform) and is committed to implementing adequate security. Fit-C will assist you in fulfilling data subject rights requests and in ensuring compliance (we provide features like consent recording, data export, deletion, etc.). We have executed (or can upon request execute) a Data Processing Addendum reflecting these commitments, including standard clauses if needed for international transfers. In event of any conflict between such DPA and these Terms, the DPA will prevail regarding data protection matters.</p>
<p>Confidentiality: Any business, technical, or personal data that one party (or its users) discloses to the other which is not publicly available shall be considered confidential information. Your Centre Data is your confidential info (even if not marked as such), and our software and any non-public information about our pricing or product plans is our confidential info. Each party agrees to protect the other&apos;s confidential info with the same degree of care as it uses for its own (at least a reasonable standard of care) and not to use it except for fulfilling the contract or as permitted. We (and our staff) will keep your data confidential and not disclose it to third parties except as allowed (service sub-providers under similar duty, or if required by law with notice to you). Likewise, if we share any non-public metrics or you learn about our code, you’d keep that confidential. This mutual confidentiality obligation survives termination. (Note: Publicity exceptions – see Section 8 about referring to you as client – that is not confidential if you agree to be listed, for instance.)</p>
<p>Data Access and Control: You may export your data from the platform at any time through available features or by requesting it from us. Fit-C will not withhold your data as long as you have paid any due amounts. Upon termination (or periodically), you should export any needed data for your records. Fit-C retains backups as per Privacy Policy Section 8, but we are not your data archive – we encourage regular backups on your side for critical data as well.</p>
<p>Security Incident: In the event Fit-C becomes aware of a security incident leading to unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure of your personal data on our systems, we will promptly notify you and provide information on what data was affected. We will also take steps to mitigate and remedy the breach. We expect you to cooperate in such situations, for instance, providing notices to individuals if required by law (Fit-C will assist with info needed). Both parties will discuss and coordinate any public communication or required disclosure about the incident. Fit-C&apos;s notification will be to your admin or designated contact.</p>
<p>Data Localization: At present, Fit-C&apos;s primary servers are in [India/appropriate region], but as noted in the Privacy Policy, data may be processed outside India with safeguards. We ensure compliance with cross-border data transfer rules (e.g., not sending data to prohibited jurisdictions). If you require that all data remain within India or another specific region, please inform us; we will try to accommodate or let you know if it&apos;s not feasible.</p>
<p>In summary, your data is yours; we protect and use it only to serve you. We take privacy seriously. If you have specific data governance needs (like deletion schedules or audit logging requirements), discuss with us and we’ll align the service as possible to meet them.</p>
<p>6. Intellectual Property Rights</p>
<p>Fit-C IP: All rights, title, and interest in and to the Fit-C Centre Platform (including software, code, algorithms, UI design, templates, reports generated by the software, documentation, our website content, trademarks, and service marks) are and shall remain the exclusive property of Fit-C and/or its licensors. These are protected by intellectual property laws. Except for the limited license granted to you in Section 2, nothing in these Terms transfers or licenses any Fit-C IP to you. If you provide any suggestions, feedback or ideas regarding the platform to Fit-C, you acknowledge that Fit-C may freely use and incorporate those without any obligation to you. Any improvements or modifications to the service, whether suggested by you or arising from usage, shall be owned by Fit-C.</p>
<p>Centre IP and Content: You retain ownership of all intellectual property in the content or materials you provide to us or upload onto the platform. For example, your Centre&apos;s name, logo, brand assets, and any original content like exercise videos, diet charts, or articles you upload are your IP. You grant Fit-C a worldwide, royalty-free, license to use, reproduce, display, and distribute your content within the platform as needed to provide the services. This includes, for example, showing your logo to members in the app, or hosting a PDF diet plan you uploaded so that members can download it. Fit-C will not use your trademarks or content outside the scope of providing or marketing the service to you or as permitted by you. (We might, for instance, list your Centre as a client on our website using your name and logo, but we’d likely ask permission or consider this Terms as permission – see Publicity below.) You represent that you have the necessary rights to any content you use on the platform and that our use of it per the agreement will not infringe any third-party rights. If you use any third-party materials (like music in a video, or images) on the platform, you must ensure you have licenses for those and indemnify Fit-C against any claims (see Section 10).</p>
<p>Publicity: Fit-C may want to highlight the fact that you are using our platform, in our marketing or case studies. We ask for the right to use your Centre&apos;s name and logo as a part of a client list or testimonial, for instance, “XYZ Gym uses Fit-C to power its member experience.” This will be limited to factual statements, and we’ll not imply endorsement beyond the use of our service. If you have a strict policy against this, you can notify us to opt-out. Conversely, we’d be delighted if you shout out Fit-C as your technology partner – any co-marketing can be mutually arranged.</p>
<p>Third-Party IP: The platform may include some third-party components (libraries, APIs, etc.) and their licenses will be respected. Conversely, you might integrate or upload third-party content; you need to ensure that doesn’t violate any IP. Fit-C has a process for DMCA or IP infringement claims if any content on the platform is alleged to infringe someone&apos;s rights. If such a claim arises related to your use, we will notify you and you must promptly address it (remove the content or prove you have rights). Fit-C may remove content that is clearly infringing to comply with law. Fit-C will handle any claims that the platform itself infringes others’ IP (see Section 10 on Indemnity for how we cover you in that scenario).</p>
<p>7. Service Levels and Support	
Fit-C aims to provide a reliable, high-availability service, but some clarifications on uptime and support:</p>
<p>Uptime Commitment: Fit-C strives for at least [99%] uptime of the Centre Platform during each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance and events of force majeure (see Section 13). While not guaranteeing it here as a strict SLA (unless separately agreed in an SLA document), we recognize the importance of the platform to your operations and will make commercially reasonable efforts to minimize downtime. Scheduled maintenance (for example, server upgrades) will typically be planned during off-peak hours (likely latenight IST or weekends) and we will notify you in advance via dashboard or email of any significant downtime maintenance windows. Unscheduled outages (due to bugs, data center issues, etc.) will be treated with top priority by our tech team.</p>
<p>Support Services: Fit-C will provide technical support and customer success services to assist you in using the platform. Support channels include email support (at support@fit-c.com), our in-app chat, and a support portal with FAQs. Our support hours are [e.g., Monday to Friday 9am-7pm IST for standard issues, with emergency support for critical issues outside hours]. We endeavor to respond to support queries within [24 hours] for normal priority issues and within [2 hours] for critical issues (like total service outage). We categorize issues by severity:</p>
<p>Critical (Severity 1): System is down or major function is unusable, impacting all users.</p>
<p>High (Severity 2): Significant impairment (e.g., payments not processing, or core feature malfunction for many users).</p>
<p>Medium (Severity 3): Partial loss of functionality or bug that has workaround.</p>
<p>Low (Severity 4): Minor issue or general question.
Our response and resolution targets will align with these severities (we can share a detailed support policy if requested).</p>
<p>Training and Onboarding: As part of support, we may provide onboarding assistance such as training sessions for your staff, help with initial data migration (uploading member lists, etc.), and resources like user guides. We encourage you to take advantage of these to get the most from Fit-C. Some extensive training or on-site support might be separately chargeable (if beyond standard inclusion), but we’ll clarify that in advance.</p>
<p>Updates and Changes: Fit-C will update the platform with new features, improvements, and bug fixes from time to time. These updates are generally included at no additional cost as part of your subscription (unless a wholly new module is introduced that we decide to price separately). We will try to ensure new updates do not disrupt existing features; any major changes to user experience will be communicated. However, given the nature of SaaS, you will typically get the updates automatically without needing to manually upgrade software. We appreciate feedback on new features. We also reserve the right to remove or deprecate features that are obsolete or not widely used, but if such removal would materially affect your usage, we’ll inform you and work on alternatives.</p>
<p>Data Backups: Fit-C keeps regular backups of your data as a safety measure (as described, typically daily incrementals, etc.). If you accidentally delete something or have an issue where data is lost due to your action, we may assist (where feasible) in recovering from recent backups, but cannot guarantee full restoration especially if it&apos;s a partial loss or if much time has elapsed. There might be a professional service fee for extensive recovery tasks depending on the scenario (we’d discuss with you). That said, catastrophic data loss on our side is extremely unlikely due to redundancies.</p>
<p>Third-Party Services & Disclaimer: Some features of the platform might rely on third-party services (e.g., video streaming via Zoom API, or sending emails via an SMTP service). While we integrate them for your benefit, we cannot warrant those external services’ performance. If a third-party service fails or changes their API, we will do our best to adapt quickly, but such issues might be outside our direct control. We’ll communicate any known disruptions (e.g., “SMS provider is facing issues, so OTPs might be delayed”) as we learn of them.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Other than explicit commitments made, the service is provided “as is” and “as available” and we disclaim any other warranties (see Section 9). We believe in our service quality but also acknowledge that technology can encounter unexpected problems.</p>
<p>8. Responsibility for Workout Plans, Training Practices, and Health Guidance</p>
<p>The Centre expressly agrees and acknowledges that all fitness training activities, workout programs, dietary plans, and health-related guidance delivered to Users through the Fit-C platform are devised and administered either by the Centre directly or by Trainers employed or affiliated with the Centre.</p>
<p>Such content and activities are created at the sole discretion and professional judgment of the Centre or its assigned Trainers, based on their expertise, understanding of user requirements, and prevailing fitness practices. Fit-C plays no role in the development, customization, approval, or monitoring of such training or dietary content.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Fit-C shall not be held liable in any manner whatsoever for:</p>
<p>Injuries, health conditions, or complications experienced by Users;</p>
<p>Misinformation, errors, or negligence in training or diet planning;</p>
<p>Psychological or physical harm resulting from participation in Centre-led programs.</p>
<p>Any dispute or claim arising from such training, including but not limited to bodily injury, illness, dissatisfaction, or lack of results, shall be exclusively between the User, the Centre, and/or the Trainer concerned.</p>
<p>The Centre further warrants that it shall ensure all Trainers associated with its facility:</p>
<p>Possess valid qualifications or certifications as per applicable fitness industry standards;</p>
<p>Conduct themselves professionally and in accordance with applicable health and safety regulations;</p>
<p>Refrain from making exaggerated, misleading, or unverified health claims;</p>
<p>Maintain appropriate conduct, hygiene, and consent while engaging with Users;</p>
<p>Disclose any known risks or medical contraindications associated with workouts.</p>
<p>In the event of any legal claim, user complaint, or statutory action involving a Centre&apos;s Trainer, Fit-C shall not be considered a party and the Centre agrees to fully indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Fit-C from any resulting loss, damages, claims, or legal costs.</p>
<p>9. AI Chatbot and Event Marketplace Disclaimers</p>
<p>Fit-C offers optional AI-powered tools including the Engagement Engine and Event Marketplace to assist Centres and Trainers in delivering enhanced digital fitness experiences. These tools may:</p>
<p>Recommend workouts, challenges, or nutrition tips;</p>
<p>Send nudges for inactivity, missed sessions, or goal tracking;</p>
<p>Suggest trainers or events based on user preferences.</p>
<p>All AI-generated recommendations are general in nature, algorithm-driven, and not clinically supervised. The Centre agrees that such content does not replace professional advice and that Fit-C makes no warranty or representation regarding its accuracy, effectiveness, or suitability.</p>
<p>Centres and Trainers utilizing these AI modules remain solely responsible for validating, reviewing, and ensuring the appropriateness of any automated communication or recommendations that reach Users.</p>
<p>The Event Marketplace is a listing feature that enables Centres and Trainers to host bootcamps, classes, challenges, and more. Fit-C does not:</p>
<p>Vet or certify event content or trainers;</p>
<p>Guarantee attendance or revenue;</p>
<p>Assume responsibility for injuries, misconduct, or cancellations.</p>
<p>The Centre acknowledges that event quality, compliance, safety, and participant satisfaction are fully its own responsibility and agrees to indemnify Fit-C from any liability related to its use of the Marketplace feature.</p>
<p>10. Limitation of Liability	
This section limits the liability that Fit-C may have to you under this agreement, and vice versa in some respects:</p>
<p>Indirect Damages: Neither party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings, or loss of data, arising out of or related to this agreement or use of the platform, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, even if the possibility of such damages was advised or foreseeable. This means, for example, Fit-C isn’t liable for your losses if the platform being down for a day causes you to lose some business or if a bug causes inconvenience, as those are indirect consequences. Likewise, you aren’t liable to us for, say, loss of profits if you breach and we lose some market opportunity.</p>
<p>Direct Damages Cap: To the fullest extent permitted by law, each party&apos;s aggregate liability for any and all claims arising from or related to this agreement (whether in contract, tort including negligence, or any other theory) is limited to the total amount of fees paid (or payable) by you to Fit-C in the 12 months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim. If the liability arises in your first year of service, then the cap would be the amount paid/pro-rated for that year up to the claim time. For example, if you’ve paid ₹1,00,000 in the last year, and a claim arises, Fit-C&apos;s maximum liability for that and all other claims together is ₹1,00,000.</p>
<p>Exceptions to Cap: The above limitations and exclusions do not apply to certain liabilities that cannot be limited by law. Specifically: (a) any liability arising from a party&apos;s fraud or willful misconduct; (b) liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence; (c) your payment obligations (i.e., money you owe us isn’t capped by what you paid – you have to pay what&apos;s due fully); and (d) each party&apos;s indemnification obligations under Section 10 for third-party claims (indemnity may have its own cap or not, as stated therein). Some jurisdictions do not allow limitation of liability for certain damages, so if a court of competent jurisdiction finds the above exclusion of indirect damages or the cap invalid, the parties agree that the liability will be limited to the minimum extent permissible.</p>
<p>Data/Privacy Liability: Fit-C&apos;s liability for data breach or privacy violations, if any, would be considered within the context of direct damages (e.g., costs you incur to notify members, etc., up to the cap) except to the extent required by law or covered by indemnity (if a third-party claim, it falls under indemnity possibly). We do not assume unlimited liability for data breaches, but our commitment and measures aim to prevent them entirely.</p>
<p>Basis of Bargain: You acknowledge that Fit-C is offering the service and pricing it based on the assumption of these limited liabilities. Higher liability would likely mean higher fees or different terms. This Section is thus an essential part of the bargain between us and applies regardless of the success of any exclusive remedy.</p>
<p>11. Disclaimer of Warranties	
Fit-C provides the Centre Platform to you on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied, except as explicitly stated in these Terms. To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
<p>Fit-C specifically disclaims all implied warranties including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade. We do not warrant that the functions contained in the platform will meet your requirements, or that operation of the platform will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that all defects will be corrected. While we aim for high uptime, we cannot guarantee 100% uptime.</p>
<p>Fit-C does not make any warranty as to the results that may be obtained from use of the service, or that the results (like increased retention, revenue, etc.) will be accurate or reliable or fit your expectations. For example, we cannot promise that using our CRM will guarantee member retention improvement, even though it&apos;s designed for that outcome – too many factors beyond the software.</p>
<p>No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from Fit-C or through the service shall create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms. You acknowledge that technology has inherent complexities and that minor errors or interruptions in service are possible. We promise to do our best, but not to be perfect.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions’ laws might not allow exclusion of an implied warranty, in which case we limit implied warranties to the minimum extent allowed or the warranty period to 30 days from first use, etc., where legally possible. But Indian law (and many others) permits such disclaimers in B2B services.</p>
<p>12. Indemnification	
This section details who defends whom if certain third-party claims arise:</p>
<p>Centre&apos;s Indemnity: You (the Centre) agree to indemnify, defend (at Fit-C&apos;s request), and hold harmless Fit-C and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any and all third-party claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that arise out of or relate to: (a) your or your Authorized Users’ breach of these Terms or violation of applicable law; (b) any content or data you or your users provide or make available through the platform (for example, if you uploaded a photo you didn’t have rights to and the copyright owner sues, or if you collected personal data without proper consent and a claim arises); (c) your use of the platform in violation of someone&apos;s rights (for instance, sending defamatory or illegal messages to members via our service); or (d) any dispute between you and a member, trainer, or other third party in connection with your operations (like a member suing you for an incident at your gym unrelated to our tech, but somehow tries to implicate the software – that&apos;s on you to handle). This indemnity basically covers situations where Fit-C gets roped into a legal claim because of your actions or data. We will: (i) promptly notify you of such claim (and give details, though delay in notice only relieves you to the extent it prejudiced your defense), (ii) allow you to control the defense and settlement (provided you diligently pursue it and any settlement that imposes non-monetary obligations on us requires our consent), and (iii) cooperate reasonably at your expense. We reserve the right to participate with counsel of our choice at our own expense, or take over if you fail to defend timely.</p>
<p>Fit-C&apos;s Indemnity: Fit-C will indemnify and hold you (and your officers, directors) harmless against any third-party claim to the extent it alleges that the Fit-C Centre Platform, as provided by us and used in accordance with these Terms, infringes a third party&apos;s intellectual property rights (patent, copyright, or trademark). If such a claim arises, Fit-C may at its option: (a) procure the right for you to continue using the service; (b) modify or replace the infringing part of the service so it becomes non-infringing while providing substantially similar functionality; or (c) if options (a) and (b) are not commercially feasible, terminate your use of the affected service and refund any prepaid fees for the remaining subscription term. Fit-C will not have liability or duty under this indemnity to the extent the claim arises from: (i) use of the platform in combination with other products or services not provided by Fit-C (if the infringement would have been avoided by not combining, for example, you add an add-on that causes infringement), (ii) any content or data you provided (someone&apos;s patent on a workout method doesn’t make our software infringe, that&apos;s on content), (iii) use of the service in a manner not in accordance with documentation or these Terms, or (iv) a feature or modification made to your specifications (if we built something custom for you and it infringes because of what you asked for, we would have likely disclaimed that in a custom dev agreement). The procedure for indemnification is similar: you notify us promptly of the claim, give us sole control of defense/settlement (we won’t settle any claim admitting fault or payment by you without your consent), and you cooperate with us. This section states your exclusive remedy for any IP infringement by the service.</p>
<p>Mutual Indemnity for certain breaches: If either party breaches confidentiality obligations or data protection laws such that the other party faces a third-party claim (like a user suing for data leak), the breaching party should indemnify the other. This is somewhat covered by saying “breach of these Terms or law” in Centre&apos;s indemnity and implicitly in Fit-C&apos;s above (to an extent IP was specified but we can also consider privacy claims under that if they arise from our service failure). If needed, we can clarify: Fit-C will indemnify you for third-party claims arising from our material breach of our data protection obligations under Section 5 (unless the breach was due to your actions), with similar process.</p>
<p>Each party&apos;s indemnification obligations are capped as per Liability section (unless the law forbids capping third-party claims – typically contractual indemnities can be capped, often at some multiple of fees, but parties might agree differently). Here, given the critical nature, Fit-C&apos;s IP indemnity could be uncapped or capped at some higher threshold. However, nothing stops an IP claimant from seeking more from Fit-C directly, so practically we handle it. We can say indemnity is subject to the Limitations of Liability except for IP claims where direct damages cap might not apply to Fit-C&apos;s obligation to third-party (we can take on full claim cost, presumably covered by insurance).</p>
<p>13. Term and Termination</p>
<p>Term: These Terms commence on the date you first accept them (or first access the Centre Platform, if earlier) and continue for the duration of your subscription. Your initial subscription term will be as specified (e.g., one year from sign-up). Thereafter, the subscription may automatically renew for successive terms (of the same length, unless otherwise stated), unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least 3 months before the end of the then-current term (if a different notice period is set in an Order Form or plan, that applies, but here 3 months is required as per our agreement). The purpose of this notice period is to allow both parties to manage transitions; if you decide not to renew, 3 months gives us time to help you off-board and for you to retrieve data. If Fit-C chooses not to continue (which is rare unless we&apos;re exiting the business or something), we’d also give you 3 months heads up so you can find alternatives. We may also agree to specific renewal terms each time (some enterprise clients don’t like auto-renew without explicit renewal POs – in absence of that, auto-renew with 3-month opt-out stands).</p>
<p>Termination for Convenience: Either party may terminate these Terms and your subscription for convenience (without cause) by providing at least 3 months’ prior written notice to the other party. However, any such termination can typically only be effective at the end of a subscription term (we’d prefer you utilize the non-renewal for convenience at term end). If you terminate mid-term without cause, note that fees for the remainder of the term are still due and non-refundable (unless we negotiate otherwise). Fit-C&apos;s right to mid-term terminate for convenience would normally not be used except under special circumstances (like we decide to discontinue the product entirely, etc.), and in such cases we’d likely refund any prepaid fees pro-rata. The 3-month notice is aligned with both renewal and termination scenario.</p>
<p>Termination for Cause: Either party may terminate this agreement (including your subscription) upon written notice to the other if the other party materially breaches these Terms and fails to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving a written notice describing the breach. For instance, if you fail to pay an invoice and remain delinquent for 30 days after notice, or if we significantly fail to provide the service as promised and don’t fix it. For breaches that are not curable (like a violation of confidentiality that already caused damage, or you go insolvent), the termination can be immediate upon notice. Fit-C may also suspend or terminate your access immediately if we determine that you have violated Section 4 (Acceptable Use) in a way that threatens security or legality (e.g., you&apos;re using the platform for something illegal, spamming, etc.), but we would ideally inform you and allow a quick remedy if possible. We’ll use suspension first for issues rather than full termination, if that makes sense and unless prohibited by law or safety issues.</p>
<p>Effect of Termination: Upon termination or expiration of your subscription for any reason, your right to access and use the Centre Platform will cease. We suggest that before the termination date, you export all your data (Fit-C will reasonably assist with this upon request). Fit-C will disable your account on the effective date. We may retain your data for a short period as described in the Privacy Policy (for example, 90 days) in case you change your mind or need something, after which we will delete or anonymize personal data. Any fees accrued up to termination are payable immediately (if not already paid). If termination is due to your uncured breach, and you had paid for a future period, Fit-C is not obligated to refund those (we may offset them against damages). If termination is due to Fit-C&apos;s breach or discontinuation, we will refund any prepaid fees for the remaining term on a pro-rata basis (as your sole remedy).</p>
<p>Return of Materials: Each party will return or destroy the other&apos;s confidential information upon termination (at the disclosing party&apos;s request). For Fit-C, that means deleting your Centre Data except as retained by law; for you, it means deleting any of our internal docs, SDKs, or admin credentials not public. If we provided any hardware or special equipment (unlikely in SaaS, but say a custom kiosk device), you’d return that or certify destruction.</p>
<p>Transition Assistance: If requested and reasonably feasible, Fit-C can provide additional transition assistance (like data migration support to a new system) at our then-current rates for professional services, unless termination was due to our breach in which case we’ll reasonably help at no additional cost to ensure you can continue your business elsewhere. Both parties should work to ensure minimal disruption to your end-users in the event of termination.</p>
<p>Survival: Provisions of these Terms which by their nature or express terms should survive termination (such as payment obligations, confidentiality, data protection clauses, indemnities, disclaimers, and limitations of liability, and governing law/dispute resolution) shall survive.</p>
<p>14. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</p>
<p>Governing Law: These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Specifically, it will be subject to applicable central and state laws relevant to contracts and IT services. The parties agree that the provisions of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 apply, as do relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and other statutes concerning electronic transactions and data protection (unless superseded by DPDP Act once fully effective, which we will comply with).</p>
<p>Arbitration: In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, including the breach, termination, or validity thereof, the parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute by negotiation. If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days from the date one party notifies the other of the issue, then the dispute shall be finally resolved by arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The arbitration shall be conducted in Hyderabad, India (or another agreed location, but Hyderabad by default), in the English language. There shall be a sole arbitrator mutually appointed by the parties. If we cannot agree on an arbitrator within 15 days of the matter referring to arbitration, either party may request the competent court or institution (like the Hyderabad chapter of ICA or SIAC if agreed) to appoint one. The arbitral award shall be final and binding on both parties, and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. The costs of arbitration (arbitrator fees etc.) shall be borne as determined in the award, or equally if not specified, but each party will bear its own attorneys’ fees unless awarded otherwise.</p>
<p>Interim Relief: Notwithstanding the above, either party may seek interim or preliminary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction (for example, to prevent misuse of intellectual property or confidential information, or to enforce a temporary restraining order while arbitration is pending). Seeking such relief shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</p>
<p>Jurisdiction: Subject to the arbitration clause, the courts located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any matters not subject to arbitration (or for judicial proceedings in aid of arbitration, such as interim measures or enforcement of awards). Both parties consent to this jurisdiction, and waive any objections based on venue or inconvenient forum.</p>
<p>Governing Language: These Terms are drawn up in English. If they are translated into any other language for reference, the English text shall prevail in the event of any inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Time Limit: Any claim or cause of action arising out of these Terms must be brought within 2 years after the party knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the claim (except for non-payment, or IP claims which have their own statutes), or it shall be deemed waived.</p>
<p>15. Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>Force Majeure: Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance of its obligations (except payment obligations) if such failure or delay is caused by events beyond its reasonable control (“Force Majeure”). This includes, but is not limited to, acts of God, natural disasters, strikes or labor disputes, war, terrorism, civil commotion, pandemics or epidemics, governmental actions, internet or power outages not caused by the party, or failure of third-party service providers (like cloud or telecom) due to such events. The affected party shall notify the other of the Force Majeure event and use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and ensure the effects of such event are minimized. If such an event continues for an extended period (e.g., more than 60 days), either party may have the right to terminate the affected services upon written notice.</p>
<p>Relationship of Parties: The relationship between Fit-C and the Centre is that of independent contractors. Nothing in these Terms shall be construed to create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the parties. Neither party has authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action, binding on the other, except as explicitly provided herein. Fit-C is not an agent or employer of your trainers or members, and you are not an agent of Fit-C.</p>
<p>Assignment: You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without Fit-C&apos;s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). Any attempted assignment in violation of this clause is void. Fit-C may assign this agreement or any rights/obligations to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to the service, with notice to you. Subject to the above, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
<p>Entire Agreement: These Terms, along with any Order Forms, annexes, or documents incorporated by reference (like the Privacy Policy, any DPA, and if applicable, a separate SLA or support policy), constitute the entire agreement between the parties regarding the Centre Platform, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, negotiations, and communications (written or oral) between you and Fit-C concerning the subject matter. Any terms and conditions that appear on a purchase order or other document provided by you (even if signed or acknowledged) shall be void and of no effect as to the subject of these Terms, unless specifically agreed in writing by Fit-C as an amendment.</p>
<p>Severability: If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible to reflect the intent of the parties (or reformed if necessary), and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect. The parties will negotiate in good faith a valid and enforceable provision that is as close as possible to the intent of the original provision.</p>
<p>No Waiver: No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under these Terms shall constitute a waiver of that right. Any waiver must be explicit and in writing to be effective, and one waiver shall not imply any future waivers. Similarly, a single or partial exercise of a right doesn’t prevent further exercise of that or any other right.</p>
<p>Notices: Any notices or communications required or permitted under these Terms (other than routine operational communications) must be in writing and will be deemed given: (i) if by personal delivery or courier, when delivered; (ii) if by email, when the email is sent to the designated notice address (unless a bounce-back or error is received), provided that a copy is also sent by another method for formal notice; or (iii) if by registered or certified mail, on the 5th business day after posting. The notice addresses are: For Fit-C, the address and email on our website&apos;s contact (Attn: Legal Department) or as given in an Order; for you, the address we have on file for your account or principal place of business, and email to the registered admin contact. Either party can change its notice address by informing the other in writing.</p>
<p>Headings and Interpretation: The headings of sections are for convenience only and have no legal effect. Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa. “Including” means “including without limitation.” If an ambiguity or question of intent arises, these Terms will be construed as if drafted jointly by both parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring either party because of authorship.</p>
<p>Third-Party Beneficiaries: Except as explicitly provided (like Apple/Google as third-party beneficiaries of certain clauses when the app is distributed via their stores), there are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms. That means only you and Fit-C (and permitted assigns) can enforce this agreement. Your members are not party to this contract with Fit-C, though they have their rights via you and perhaps via terms of use they accept on the user app.</p>
<p>Changes to Terms: Except as otherwise stated, any modification to these Terms must be in writing and signed by both parties (this doesn’t apply to general updates we post, which we handle per the earlier sections on modifications and acceptance via continued use, especially if they&apos;re not materially adverse to you). In the event of a conflict between these Terms and an Order Form, the Order&apos;s specific terms will prevail for that Order.</p>
<p>By using the Fit-C Centre Dashboard, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms & Conditions. We look forward to a successful partnership in empowering your fitness business!</p>
